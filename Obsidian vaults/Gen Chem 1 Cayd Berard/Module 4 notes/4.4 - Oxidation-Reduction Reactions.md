<u>Oxidation</u> - The loss of electrons in a chemical reaction. 

<u>Reduction</u> - The gain of electron in a chemical reaction.

Reactions involving oxidation are called "oxidation-reduction" as the loss of electrons of one substance results in the gain of electrons in another (ex: Iron loses electrons to Oxygen when it rusts).

<u>Oxidation-Reduction reactions</u> - reactions that exhibit a change in the oxidation states of one or more elements in the reactants by a transfer of electrons.

"oxidation is loss, reduction is gain"

<u>Oxidation state</u> - The charge that each atom in a compound would have if all its bonding electrons were transferred to the atom with the greater attraction for electrons.

Atoms in their elemental form, such as O<sub>2</sub> or H<sub>2</sub>, are assigned an oxidation state of zero

When giving oxidation states to elements in binary compounds:
- the oxidation states of the elements are identical to the charges on the monatomic ions

<u>Rules for Assigning Oxidation States</u>
1. The oxidation state of an atom in any pure element, whether monatomic, diatomic, or polyatomic, is zero.

2. The oxidation state of a monatomic ion is the same as its charge—for example, Na<sup>+</sup> = +1, Cl<sup>−</sup> = −1.

3. The oxidation state of fluorine in chemical compounds is always −1. Other halogens usually have oxidation states of −1 as well, except when combined with oxygen or other halogens.

4. Hydrogen is assigned an oxidation state of +1 in its compounds with nonmetals and −1 in its compounds with metals.

5. Oxygen is normally assigned an oxidation state of −2 in compounds, with two exceptions: in compounds that contain oxygen–fluorine or oxygen–oxygen bonds, the oxidation state of oxygen is determined by the oxidation states of the other elements present.

6. The sum of the oxidation states of all the atoms in a neutral molecule or ion must equal the charge on the molecule or ion.

**In any chemical reaction, the net charge must be conserved; that is, in a chemical reaction, the total number of electrons is constant, just like the total number of atoms


<u>Example:</u>
Assign oxidation states to all atoms in each compound:

barium fluoride ($BaF_2$)

Ba, +2; F, -1

Important types of redox reactions:

- <u>Synthesis</u> reactions - The formation of any compound directly from the elements is a redox reaction, for example, the formation of water from hydrogen and oxygen:
		$2H_{2}(g)+O_{2}(g) \rightarrow 2H_{2}O(g)$
		
- <u>Decomposition</u> reactions - the decomposition of a compound to its elements is also a redox reaction, as in the electrolysis of water:
		$2H_{2}O(l) \rightarrow 2H_{2}(g) + O_{2}(g)$

- <u>Combustion</u> reactions - Many chemicals combust (burn) with oxygen. In particular, organic chemicals such as hydrocarbons burn in the presence of oxygen to produce carbon dioxide and water as the products:
		$CH_{4}(g)+2O_{2}(g) \rightarrow CO_{2}(g)+2H_{2}O(g)$

<span style="color:#00b0f0"><u>Single-Displacement Reactions</u></span>

<u>Single-Displacement Reactions</u> - A chemical reaction in which an ion in solution is displaced through oxidation of a metal.

Examples:

$Zn(s)+Fe^{2+}(aq)\rightarrow Zn^{2+}(aq)+Fe(s)$

$Cu(s)+2Ag^{+}(aq)\rightarrow Cu^{2+}(aq)+2Ag(s)$

The metals at the top of the series (active metals), which have the greatest tendency to lose electrons and the opposite is true for the bottom of the list (inert metals):

When predicting the outcome of a reaction using the list, keep in mind that _any element will reduce compounds of the elements below it in the series_.

<span style="color:#00b0f0"><u>Summary</u></span>

Oxidation–reduction reactions are balanced by separating the overall chemical equation into an oxidation equation and a reduction equation. In oxidation–reduction reactions, electrons are transferred from one substance or atom to another. We can balance oxidation–reduction reactions in solution using the oxidation state method, in which the overall reaction is separated into an oxidation equation and a reduction equation. There are many types of redox reactions. Single-displacement reactions are reactions of metals with either acids or another metal salt that result in dissolution of the first metal and precipitation of a second (or evolution of hydrogen gas). The outcome of these reactions can be predicted using the activity series, which arranges metals and H2 in decreasing order of their tendency to be oxidized. Any metal will reduce metal ions below it in the activity series. Active metals lie at the top of the activity series, whereas inert metals are at the bottom of the activity series.
