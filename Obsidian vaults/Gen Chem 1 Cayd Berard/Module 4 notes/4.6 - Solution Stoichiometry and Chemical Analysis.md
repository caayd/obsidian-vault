<u>Titration</u> - a technique where a solution of known concentration is used to determine the concentration of an unknown solution

In a <u>titration</u>, a carefully measured volume of a solution of known concentration, called the _titrant_, is added to a measured volume of a solution containing a compound whose concentration is to be determined (the unknown). 
- The reaction used in a titration can be an acid–base reaction, a precipitation reaction, or an oxidation–reduction reaction

[[equivalence point]] - The point in a titration where a stoichiometric amount ( the amount required to react completely with the unknown) of the titrant has been added.

Ex:

The reaction of $MnO_{4}~^{−}$ with oxalic acid ($HO_{2}CCO_{2}H$) in acidic aqueous solution produces $Mn_{2}~^{+}$ and $CO_{2}$:
$\left(\underset{\large\text{purple}}{MnO_{4}^{-}~(\text{aq})+HO_{2}CCO_{2}H(\text{aq})}\rightarrow \underset{\large\text{colorless}}{Mn^{2+}(\text{aq})}+CO_{2}(\text{g})+H_{2}O(\text{l})\right)$
