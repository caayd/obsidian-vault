<u>Precipitation reaction</u> - a reaction that yields an insoluble product—a precipitate—when two solutions are mixed.

General form of an exchange reaction:

$\overbrace{AC}^{soluble} + \overbrace{BD}^{soluble} \longrightarrow \underbrace{AC}_{insoluble} + \overbrace{BD}^{soluble}$
The annotations in this example are not characteristic of all exchange reaction (both products can be soluble or insoluble).

<u>Precipitation reactions</u> (aka double-displacement reactions) are a subclass of exchange reactions that occur between ionic compounds when one of the products is insoluble

<u>Spectator Ions</u> - ions that do not participate in the actual reaction. they are present on both sides of an equation and their coefficients stay the same.
