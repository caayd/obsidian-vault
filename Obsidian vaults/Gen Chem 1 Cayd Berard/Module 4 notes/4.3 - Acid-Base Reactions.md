<span style="color:#00b0f0"><u>Definitions of Acids and Bases</u></span>

<u>Acids</u> - defined as substances that dissolve in water to produce $H^+$ ions.
<u>Bases</u> - defined as substances that dissolve in water to produce $OH^-$ (hydroxide) ions.

This is the Arrhenius definition of acids and bases

<span style="color:#00b0f0"><u>Arrhenius Definition of Acids and Bases</u></span> 

The above definitions have limitations:
- applied only to substances in aqueous solution.
- predicted that only substances that dissolve in water to produce  $H^+$ and  $OH^−$ ions should exhibit the properties of acids and bases, respectively

<span style="color:#00b0f0"><u> Brønsted–Lowry Definition</u></span> 

This definition states that an acid is any substance that can donate a proton, and a base is any substance that can accept a proton.

This definition is not restricted to aqueous solutions.

<u>Monoproctic acids</u> - compounds that are capable of donating a single proton per molecule. ($HF,~HCl,~HBr,~HI,~HNO_3,~and~HNO_2$).

<u>Carboxylic acids</u> - organic compound that contains an −OH group covalently bonded to the carbon atom of a carbonyl group (are monoproctic acids when containing a single $-CO_2H$ group).

<u>Polyproctic Acids</u> - compounds that can donate more than one proton per molecule (has sub sections such as diproctic or triproctic).



Equilibrium is the point at which the rates of the forward and reverse reactions become the same, so that the net composition of the system no longer changes with time

Example:

$CH_3CH_2CO_2H$

- This compound is a propionic acid, which is organic
- It contains a carboxylic acid group analogous to that in acetic acid, so it must be a weak acid.
