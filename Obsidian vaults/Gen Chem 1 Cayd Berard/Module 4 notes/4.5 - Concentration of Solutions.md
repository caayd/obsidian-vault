<u>Concentration</u> - The quantity of solute that is dissolved in a particular quantity of solvent or solution.

Knowing the concentration of solutes is important in controlling the stoichiometry of reactants for solution reactions

<span style="color:#00b0f0"><u>Molarity</u></span> 

<u>Molarity</u> - A common unit of concentration that is the number of moles of solute present in exactly 1 L of solution (mol/L).

$molarity=\dfrac{moles~of~solute~(mol)}{liters~of~solution~(L)}=\dfrac{moles~of~solute~(mol)}{milliliters~of~solution~(mL)}$

The units of molarity are moles per liter of solution (mol/L),  abbreviated as $M$.

---

In chemical notation, square brackets around the name or formula of the solute represent the molar concentration of a solute:

\[sucrose] = $1.00~M$

read: "the concentration of sucrose is 1.00 molar"

---

The relationships between volume, molarity, and moles may be expressed as either:

$V_{L}M_{mol}{L}=\cancel{L} \left( \dfrac{mol}{\cancel {L}} \right)$
or
$V_{mL}M_{mmol/mL}=\cancel{mL}\left(\dfrac{mmol}{\cancel {mL}} \right)$

Example:
Calculate the number of moles of sodium hydroxide (NaOH) in 2.50 L of 0.100 $M$ NaOH:

$moles~NaOH=V_{L}M_{mol/L}=(2.50~\cancel{L})\left(\dfrac{0.100~mol}{\cancel{L}} \right)=0.250~mol~NaOH$

 - A concentration expressed on an m/m basis is equal to the number of grams of solute per gram of solution
 
  - A concentration on an m/v basis is the number of grams of solute per milliliter of solution.

The volume of the solvent needed is almost always less than the desired volume of solution

45 milliliters of water remain in the graduated cylinder even after addition to the mark of the volumetric flask.

Example:
Mass and volume of solution $\longrightarrow$ concentration ($M$)

The solution contains 10.0g of $CoCl_{2}\bullet 2H_{2}O$ in enough ethanol to make exactly 500 mL of solution. what is the $M$ of $CoCl_{2}\bullet 2H_{2}O$?

1. molar mass of $CoCl_{2}\bullet 2H_{2}O$ is 165.87 g/mol
	$moles~CoCl_{2}\bullet 2H_{2}O=\left(\dfrac{10.0~\cancel{g}}{165.87~\cancel{g}/mol}\right)=0.0603~mol$
2. and the volume is:
	$volume=500\cancel{mL}\left(\dfrac{1~L}{1000~\cancel{mL}}\right)=0.500~L$
3. Molarity is the number of moles of solute per liter of solution:
	$molarity~(M)=\dfrac{0.0603~mol}{0.500~L}=\fbox{0.121~M}=CoCl_{2}\bullet 2H_{2}O$

<u>Stock solution</u> - A commercially prepared solution of known concentration.

The relationship between the volume and concentration of the stock solution and the volume and concentration of the desired diluted solution is:

$(V_{s})(M_{s})=\text{moles of solute}=(V_{d})(M_{d})$

*subscripts s and d indicate the stock and dilute solutions

<span style="color:#00b0f0"><u>Ion Concentrations in Solution</u></span> 

When carrying out a chemical reaction using a solution of a salt such as ammonium dichromate, it is important to know the concentration of each ion present in the solution.

- If a solution contains 1.43 $M$ $(NH_{4})2Cr_{2}O_{7}$, then the concentration of $Cr_{2}O_{7}~^{2−}$ must also be 1.43 $M$ because there is one $Cr_{2}O_{7}~^{2−}$  ion per formula unit. 

- However, there are two $NH_{4}~^{+}$ ions per formula unit, so the concentration of $NH_{4}~^{+}$ ions is 2 × 1.43 $M$ = 2.86 $M$.

Solution concentrations are typically expressed as molarities and can be prepared by dissolving a known mass of solute in a solvent or diluting a stock solution.
