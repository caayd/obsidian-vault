You need to classify the type of reaction occurring and to be able to now the charge of an ion.

- Group I elements (Li+, Na+, K+, Cs+, Rb+) are
- NH4+ (Ammonium ion) are soluble.
- the nitrate ion (NO3-) are generally soluble.
- of Cl-, Br-, and I- are soluble. Exceptions Ag+, Pb2+, and (Hg2)2+
- most sulfates are soluble. Exceptions: Ba2+, Ca2+, Pb2+, Ag+, Sr2+
- most hydroxide salts are only slightly soluble. Exceptions: NH4+, Li+, Na+, K+
- most carbonates (CO<sub>3</sub><sup>2-</sup>) are insoluble. Exceptions: Group 1 and NH4+
Note: Rules at the top supersede any lower rules.

<u>Single Replacement</u>

In single replacement reactions, the metals will replace the metals:

$Fe~(s)+CuSO_{4}~(aq)\rightarrow FeSO_{4}~(aq)+Cu~(s)$

$Zn~(s)+CuCl_{2}~(aq) \rightarrow ZnCl_{2}+Cu~(s)$


<u>Neutrilaziation</u> - acid and base reacts to form a salt and water

<span style="color:#00b0f0"><u>Net Ionic Equations</u></span>

A net ionic equation only indicates the ions and precipitates that are involved in the chemical reaction.

A complete ionic equation shows everything.


After balancing a chemical equation:
Steps:
1. break up (aq) species into ions
2. keep any (s) or (ppt) as they are

Ex:
The starting equation:
$Na_{2}CrO_{4}~(aq)+2AgNO_{3}~(aq)\longrightarrow 2NaNO_{3}~(aq)+Ag_{2}CrO_{4}~(s)$

gets broken into a complete ionic equation ((aq) gets split (s) stays compound):
$2Na^{+}~(aq)+CrO_{4}^{2-}~(aq)+2Ag^{+}~(aq)+2NO_{3}^{-}(aq)\longrightarrow 2Na^{+}~(aq)+2NO_{3}^{-}~(aq)+Ag_{2}CrO_{4}$
cancel out all spectator ions on both sides of the equation:
$\cancel{2Na^{+}~(aq)}+CrO_{4}^{2-}~(aq)+2Ag^{+}~(aq)+\cancel{2NO_{3}^{-}(aq)}\longrightarrow \cancel{2Na^{+}~(aq)}+\cancel{2NO_{3}^{-}(aq)}+Ag_{2}CrO_{4}~(s)$
final net ionic equation:

$CrO_{4}^{2-}~(aq)+2Ag^{+}~(aq)\longrightarrow Ag_{2}CrO_{4}~(s)$
