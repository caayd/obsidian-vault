### <u>Forms of energy</u>

The forms of energy include: 
- <u>Thermal energy</u> - results from atomic and molecular motion; faster motion = more thermal energy. 
- <u>Radiant energy</u> - energy carried by light, microwaves, and radio waves.
- <u>Electrical energy</u> - results from the flow of electrically charged particles
- <u>Nuclear energy</u> - energy stored in the nucleus of an atom.
- <u>Chemical energy</u> - energy stored within a chemical compound due to a particular arrangement of atoms.

<u>Potential energy</u> - energy stored in an object because of the relative positions or orientations of its components 

<u>Kinetic energy</u> - energy due to the motion of an object.

Example: A brick lying on the windowsill of a 10th-floor office has a great deal of potential energy. When it falls, its potential energy is transformed to kinetic energy, which is then transferred to the object on the ground that it strikes.

Electrical, nuclear, and chemical energy are different forms of potential energy (PE).

Energy can be converted from one form to another or transferred from one object to another.

### <u>Energy, Heat and Work</u>

<u>Mechanical work</u>- The energy required to move an object a distance when opposed by a force

work done = force x distance:
$w=Fd$

since force is mass times acceleration, this can also be written:
work done = mass x acceleration x distance
$w = mad$

<u>Heat (q)</u> - thermal energy that can be transferred from an object at one temperature to an object at another temperature. **The net transfer of thermal energy stops when the two objects reach the same temperature.** ^f67911

Energy is an *extensive* property of matter.

### <u>Kinetic and Potential Energy</u>

The kinetic energy (KE) of an object is related to its mass (m) and velocity (v):
$KE = \dfrac{1}{2}mv^2$

For example the kinetic energy of a 1360 kg car traveling at  avelocity of 26.8 m/s is:
$KE = \dfrac{1}{2}(1360)(26.8)^{2}=4.88\times10^{5}g\cdot{m}^{2}$

Since all forms of energy can be interconverted, energy in any form can be expressed using the same units as kinetic energy

A joule (J) is a common unit for energy and is defined as $1~\text{kilogram}\cdot\text{meter}^{2}/\text{second}$. A kilojoule (1 kJ = $10^{3}$ J)

the kinetic energy of the 1360 kg car traveling at 26.8 m/s is 4.88 × 10$^5$ J or 4.88 × 10$^2$ kJ



Because heat and work result in changes in energy, their units must also be the same.

The units of potential energy are the same as the units of kinetic energy:

![[Pasted image 20240228210220.png|300]]
![[Pasted image 20240228210253.png|500]]

The car had a resting potential energy of 4.88 x 10<sup>2</sup> kJ, when it fell it had 4.88 x 10<sup>2</sup> kJ of kinetic energy, and when it hit the ground both energies were zero.

### <u>Units of Energy</u>

<span style="color:#00b050">**The units of energy are the same regardless of the form of energy, whether thermal, radiant, chemical, or any other form.**</span>

Energy can also be expressed in the non-SI units of calories (cal), where 1 cal was originally defined as the amount of energy needed to raise the temperature of exactly 1 g of water from 14.5°C to 15.5°C.

Because calories and joules are both units of energy, the calorie can be defined in terms of the joule:
$1~cal=4.184~J~\text{exactly}$

$1~J=0.2390~cal$

### 5.1 Example questions

a) If the mass of a baseball is 149 g, what is the kinetic energy of a fastball clocked at 100 mi/h?

The kinetic energy of an object is given by $\dfrac{1}{2}mv^2$. In this case, we know both the mass and the velocity, but we must convert the velocity to SI units:

$v = \left(\dfrac{100~\cancel{mi}}{1~\cancel{h}}\right)\left(\dfrac{1~\cancel{h}}{60~\cancel{min}}\right)\left(\dfrac{1~\cancel{min}}{60~s}\right)\left(\dfrac{1.61~\cancel{km}}{1~\cancel{mi}}\right)\left(\dfrac{1000~{m}}{1~\cancel{km}}\right) = 44.7~m/s$

The kinetic energy of the baseball is therefore:
$KE = 1492~\cancel{g} \left(\dfrac{1}{1000~\cancel{g}}\right)\left(\dfrac{44.7~m}{s}\right)^{2}=1.49 \times 10^{2}~\dfrac{kg\cdot m^{2}}{s^{2}}=1.10\times10^{2}~J$

# 5.2: The First Law of Thermodynamics

---

Three kinds of systems are important in chemistry:
- <u>Open system</u> - can exchange both matter and energy with its surroundings. 
	- <span style="color:#808080">A pot of boiling water is an open system because a burner supplies energy in the form of heat, and matter in the form of water vapor is lost as the water boils.</span>
- <u>Closed system</u> - can exchange energy **but not matter with its surroundings**. 
	- <span style="color:#808080">The sealed pouch of a ready-made dinner that is dropped into a pot of boiling water is a closed system because thermal energy is transferred to the system from the boiling water but no matter is exchanged</span>
- <u>Isolated system</u> - exchanges neither energy nor matter with the surroundings. 
	- <span style="color:#808080"><u>A truly isolated system does not actually exist</u>. An insulated thermos containing hot coffee approximates an isolated system, but eventually the coffee cools as heat is transferred to the surroundings.</span> 

The total energy of a system plus its surroundings is constant, which must be true if energy is conserved.

The state of a system is a complete description of a system at a given time, including its temperature and pressure, the amount of matter it contains, its chemical composition, and the physical state of the matter.

<u>State function</u> - property of a system whose magnitude depends on only the present state of the system, not its previous history.  ^32ee1d

Temperature, pressure, volume, and potential energy are all state functions. For example, the pressure in a tire is independent of how often air is pumped into the tire for it to reach that pressure, as is the final volume of air in the tire.

Heat and work are not state functions because they are path dependent, he amount of work expended to get it there, however, can differ greatly depending on the path chosen.

### <u>Direction of Heat Flow</u>
 
 Thermochemical equations - Chemical equations in which heat is shown as either a reactant or a product.

Ex: 
$2Al(s)+Fe_{2}O_{3}\rightarrow2Fe(s)+Al_{2}O_{3}(s)+\text{heat}$

A process in which heat (q) is transferred *from* a system *to* its surroundings is described as <u>exothermic</u>. By convention,  [[Module 5 Notes Thermochemistry#^f67911|q]] < 0 for an exothermic reaction.

Example:
When you hold an ice cube in your hand, heat from the surroundings (including your hand) is transferred to the system (the ice), causing the ice to melt and your hand to become cold. We can describe this process by the following thermochemical equation:

$\text{heat}+H_{2}O(s)\rightarrow H_{2}O(l)$

When heat is transferred *to* a system *from* its surroundings, the process is <u>endothermic</u>. By convention,  [[Module 5 Notes Thermochemistry#^f67911|q]] > 0 for an endothermic reaction.

### <u>The First Law</u>

The relationship between the energy change of a system and that of its surroundings is given by the <u>first law of thermodynamics</u>, which states that the energy of the universe is constant.

This can be expressed mathematically:

$U_{univ}=\Delta U_{sys}+\Delta U_{surr}= 0$

$\Delta U_{sys}=-\Delta U_{surr}$

<span style="color:#808080">where the subscripts univ, sys, and surr refer to the universe, the system, and the surroundings respectivley.</span>

**The tendency of all systems, chemical or otherwise, is to move toward the state with the lowest possible energy.**

Because heat and work are the only two ways in which energy can be transferred between a system and its surroundings, any change in the internal energy of the system is the sum of the heat transferred (q) and the work done (w):

$\Delta U_{sys}=q+w$

  
$q$ and $w$ are not state functions on their own, their sum ($\Delta U_{sys}$) is independent of the path taken and is therefore a [[#^32ee1d|state function]].

# 5.3: Enthalpy

---

- Mechanical work arises when an object moves a distance (Δx) against an opposing force (f):
	$w_{mechanical} = f~\Delta x$
- _Electrical work_ is done when a body having a charge (q) moves through a potential difference (ΔV).
	$w_{electrical} = q~\Delta V$

When two bodies are placed in thermal contact and energy flows from the warmer body to the cooler one, this process is called <u>“heat”.</u> 
A transfer of energy to or from a system by any means other than heat is called “<u>work”</u>.

### Enthalpy as a Composite Function

PV (Pressure x Volume) work is defined as $w = -P \Delta V$

At constant pressure, the change in the enthalpy of a system is as follows:

$\Delta H=\Delta U +\Delta (PV) = \Delta U + P\Delta V$

the change in the enthalpy of a system is equal to the heat flow: $\Delta H =q_{p}$ ^6881d0

### The Relationship between $\Delta H$ and $\Delta U$

If ΔH for a reaction is known, we can use the [[#^6881d0|change in the enthalpy of the system]] to calculate its change in internal energy.

When a reaction involves only solids, liquids, liquid solutions, or any combination of these, the volume does not change appreciably (ΔV = 0) and you can instead change the equation to $\Delta H=\Delta U$.
