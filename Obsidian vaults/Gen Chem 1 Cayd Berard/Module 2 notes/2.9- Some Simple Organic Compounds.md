The simplest class of organic compounds is the hydrocarbons, which consist entirely of carbon and hydrogen.

Petroleum and natural gas are complex, naturally occurring mixtures of many different hydrocarbons that furnish raw materials for the chemical industry. 

The four major classes of hydrocarbons are the following: 
- the alkanes, which contain only carbon–hydrogen and carbon–carbon single bonds. 
- the alkenes, which contain at least one carbon–carbon double bond.
- the alkynes, which contain at least one carbon–carbon triple bond .
- the aromatic hydrocarbons, which usually contain rings of six carbon atoms that can be drawn with alternating single and double bonds. 


Alkanes are also called saturated hydrocarbons, whereas hydrocarbons that contain multiple bonds (alkenes, alkynes, and aromatics) are unsaturated.
