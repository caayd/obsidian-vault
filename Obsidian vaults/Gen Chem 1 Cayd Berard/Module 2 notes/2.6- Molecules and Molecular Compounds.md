The atoms in all substances that contain multiple atoms are held together by <u>electrostatic interactions.</u>

<u>Electrostatic interactions</u> - interactions between electrically charged particles such as protons and electrons.

<span style="color:#00b050">Electrostatic attraction</span> between two oppositely charged species results in a force that pulls them together.

<span style="color:#00b050">Electrostatic repulsion</span> between two same-charged species results in a force that pushes them away from each other.

<u>Chemical bonds</u> are generally divided into two fundamentally different types: <u>ionic</u> and <u>covalent</u>. in reality, however, the bonds in most substances are neither purely ionic nor purely covalent, but lie on a spectrum between these extremes.

 Ionic compounds consist of positively and negatively charged ions held together by strong electrostatic forces, whereas covalent compounds generally consist of molecules, which are groups of atoms in which one or more pairs of electrons are shared between bonded atoms.

<span style="color:#00b0f0"><u>Covalent Molecules and Compounds</u></span>

Just as an atom is the simplest unit that has the fundamental chemical properties of an element, **a molecule is the simplest unit that has the fundamental chemical properties of a covalent compound.**

Covalent compounds that predominantly contain carbon and hydrogen are called <u>organic compounds</u>. The conventional way to write the formula of organic compounds is to write carbon first, followed by hydrogen and then any other elements in alphabetical order.

Compounds that consist primarily of elements other than carbon and hydrogen are called <u>inorganic compounds</u>; they include both covalent and ionic compounds. In inorganic compounds, the component elements are listed beginning with the one farthest to the left in the periodic table. Those in the same group are listed beginning with the lower element and working up. **However, when an inorganic compound contains both hydrogen and an element from groups 13â€“15, hydrogen is usually listed last in the formula**

Molecular formulas give only the elemental composition of molecules. In contrast, <u>structural formulas</u> show which atoms are bonded to one another and, in some cases, the approximate arrangement of the atoms in space.

The structural formula for $H_2$ can be drawn as $H-H$, where a single line represents a sing pair of shared electrons, a single bond. A double bond is indicated by two lines, ex: $O_2$ is $O=O$.
A triple bond is indicated by three lines, ex: $N_2$ is $N \equiv N$. 

Carbon is unique in the extent to which it forms single, double, and triple bonds to itself and other elements.

<u>Number of Bonds That Selected Atoms Commonly Form to Other Atoms:</u>

| Atom         | Number of Bonds |
| ------------ |:---------------:|
| H (group 1)  |        1        |
| O (group 16) |        2        |
| N (group 15) |        3        |
| C (group 14) |        4        |

<u>Summary</u>

There are two fundamentally different kinds of chemical bonds (covalent and ionic) that cause substances to have very different properties. The atoms in chemical compounds are held together by attractive electrostatic interactions known as chemical bonds. The molecular formula of a covalent compound gives the types and numbers of atoms present. Compounds that contain predominantly carbon and hydrogen are called organic compounds, whereas compounds that consist primarily of elements other than carbon and hydrogen are inorganic compounds. Diatomic molecules contain two atoms, and polyatomic molecules contain more than two. A structural formula indicates the composition and approximate structure and shape of a molecule. Covalent molecular compounds, in contrast, consist of discrete molecules held together by weak intermolecular forces and can be gases, liquids, or solids at room temperature and pressure.
