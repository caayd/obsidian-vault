When chemists synthesize a new compound, they may not know its molecular/structural formula so they instead start by determining its <u>empirical formula.</u>

<span style="color:#ffc000"><u>Empirical formula</u></span> - the relative numbers of atoms of the elements in a compound, reduced to the smallest whole numbers.

Since empirical formula only shows the ratios of the number of elements preset.

For example, butane's molecular formula is $C_{4}H_{10}$. The ratio of carbon atoms to hydrogen atoms in butane is 4:10, which can be reduced to 2:5, making its empirical formula $C_{2}H_{5}$

The <span style="color:#ffc000"><u>formula unit</u></span> is the absolute grouping of atoms or ions represented by the empirical formula of a compound, either ionic or covalent. (essentially a multiplier for converting empirical > molecular)

Butane's empirical formula is $C_{2}H_{5}$, because it has two $C_{2}H_{5}$ <u>formula units</u>, its molecular formula $C_{4}H_{10}$.

Because ionic compounds do not contain discrete molecules, empirical formulas are used to indicate their compositions. All compounds, covalent or ionic, must be <u>electrically neutral</u>, so the positive and negative charges in a formula unit MUST cancel each other out.

<span style="color:#00b0f0"><u>Binary Ionic Compounds</u></span>

An ionic compound that contains only two elements, one present as a cation and one as an anion, is called a <u>binary ionic compound</u>.

<u>Exercise 2.8.1</u>

$Li^{+}$ and $N^{3−}$

$Li_{3}N$

<span style="color:#00b0f0"><u>Polyatomic Ions</u></span> 

<u>Polyatomic ions</u> are groups of atoms that bear net electrical charges, although the atoms in a polyatomic ion are held together by the same covalent bonds that hold atoms together in molecules.

Common polyatomic ions:

| Formula | Name | Formula | Name | Formula | Name |
| ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- |
| NH<sub>4</sub><sup>+</sup> | ammonium | HPO<sub>4</sub><sup>2-</sup> | hydrogen phosphate | CH<sub>3</sub>NH<sub>3</sub><sup>+</sup> | methylammonium |
| H<sub>2</sub>PO<sub>4</sub><sup>-</sup> | dihydrogen phosphate | OH<sup>-</sup> | hydroxide | ClO<sup>-</sup> | hypochlorite |

The method used to predict the empirical formulas for ionic compounds that contain monatomic ions can also be used for compounds that contain polyatomic ions. (the overall charge must cancel each other out).

<span style="color:#00b0f0"><u>Hydrates</u></span> 

Many ionic compounds occur as <u>hydrates</u>, which are compounds that contain specific ratios of loosely bound water molecules, called <u>waters of hydration</u>. 

Waters of hydration can often be removed simply by heating.

Compounds that differ only in the numbers of waters of hydration can have very different properties.

<span style="color:#00b0f0"><u>Binary acids</u></span> 

Some compounds containing hydrogen are members of an important class of substances known as acids.

If the compound is a binary acid (comprised of hydrogen and one other nonmetallic element):

- The word “hydrogen” is changed to the prefix hydro-
- The other nonmetallic element name is modified by adding the suffix -ic
- The word “acid” is added as a second word

For example, when the gas HCl (hydrogen chloride) is dissolved in water, the solution is called hydrochloric acid.

<span style="color:#00b0f0"><u>Oxyacids</u></span> 

<u>Oxyacids</u> are compounds that contain hydrogen, oxygen, and at least one other element, and are bonded in such a way as to impart acidic properties to the compound.

They typically consist of hydrogen combined with a polyatomic, oxygen-containing ion.

To name oxyacids:
- Omit “hydrogen”
- Start with the root name of the anion
- Replace –ate with –ic, or –ite with –ous
- Add “acid”

For example, H<sub>2</sub>CO<sub>3</sub> is called <u>carbonic acid</u> instead of hydrogen carbonate.

<span style="color:#00b0f0"><u>Bases</u></span> 

A <u>base</u> is a substance that produces one or more hydroxide ions 
(OH<sup>-</sup>) and a cation when dissolved in aqueous solution, thereby forming a basic solution.

<u>Currently, just about every base encountered right now will be an ionic compound</u>

Alcohols do not dissociate in water to form a basic solution since they are covalent compounds.

When a base reacts with any of the acids we have discussed, it accepts a proton (H<sup>+</sup>). For example, the hydroxide ion (OH<sup>-</sup>) accepts a proton to form H<sub>2</sub>O.

Bases are also referred to as <u>proton acceptors.</u>

<span style="color:#00b0f0"><u>Binary Inorganic Compounds</u></span> 

Binary covalent compounds are covalent compounds that only contain two elements.

They are named using a procedure similar to that used for simple ionic compounds, but prefixes are added as needed to indicate the number of atoms of each kind.

the procedure as follows:

<u>Prefixes for Indicating the Number of Atoms in Chemical Names</u>

|**Prefix**|**Number**|
|---|---|
|mono-|1|
|di-|2|
|tri-|3|
|tetra-|4|
|penta-|5|
|hexa-|6|
|hepta-|7|
|octa-|8|
|nona-|9|
|deca-|10|
|undeca-|11|
|dodeca-|12|
- if a molecule contains more than one atom of both elements, then prefixes are used for both. (N<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> is dinitrogen trioxide)

<span style="color:#00b0f0"><u>Summary</u></span> 

The composition of a compound is represented by an empirical or molecular formula, each consisting of at least one formula unit. Covalent inorganic compounds are named using a procedure similar to that used for ionic compounds, whereas hydrocarbons use a system based on the number of bonds between carbon atoms. Covalent inorganic compounds are named by a procedure similar to that used for ionic compounds, using prefixes to indicate the numbers of atoms in the molecular formula. An empirical formula gives the relative numbers of atoms of the elements in a compound, reduced to the lowest whole numbers. The formula unit is the absolute grouping represented by the empirical formula of a compound, either ionic or covalent. Empirical formulas are particularly useful for describing the composition of ionic compounds, which do not contain readily identifiable molecules. Some ionic compounds occur as hydrates, which contain specific ratios of loosely bound water molecules called waters of hydration.
