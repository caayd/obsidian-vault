The nucleus is itself composed of two kinds of particles. Protons are the carriers of positive electric charge in the nucleus; the proton charge is exactly the same as the electron charge, but of opposite sign.

This means that in any atom, the number of protons in the nucleus is balanced by the same number of electrons outside of the nucleus.

Another nuclear particle is the neutron, it carries no charge and has similar mass to the proton. Most nuclei contain roughly equal numbers of neutrons and protons, so we can say that these two particles together account for almost all the mass of the atom.

<u>Properties of these subatomic particles:</u>

1. Electrons and protons have electrical charges that are identical in magnitude but opposite in sign. Relative charges of âˆ’1 and +1 are assigned to the electron and proton, respectively.
2. Neutrons have approximately the same mass as protons but no charge. They are electrically neutral.
3. The mass of a proton or a neutron is about 1836 times greater than the mass of an electron. Protons and neutrons constitute the bulk of the mass of atoms.


| Particle | Mass (g) | Atomic Mass (amu) | Electrical Charge (coulombs) | Relative Charge |
| ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- |
| electron | $9.109 \times 10^{-28}$ | $0.0005486$ | $-1.602 \times 10^{-19}$ | $-1$ |
| proton | $1.673 \times 10^{-24}$ | $1.007276$ | $+1.602 \times 10^{-19}$ | $+1$ |
| neutron | $1.675 \times 10^{-24}$ | $1.008665$ | $0$ | $0$ |

<span style="color:#ffc000"><u>Isotopes</u></span>

Unlike protons, the number of neutrons is not absolutely fixed for most elements.

Atoms that have the same number of protons, and hence the same atomic number, but different numbers of neutrons are called <u>isotopes</u>. All isotopes of an element have the same number of protons and electrons, which means they exhibit the same chemistry. The isotopes of an element differ only in their atomic mass, which is given by the mass number (A), the sum of the numbers of protons and neutrons.

An isotope of any element can be uniquely represented as $^{A}_{Z}X$

<u>Summary</u>

The atom consists of discrete particles that govern its chemical and physical behavior. Each atom of an element contains the same number of protons, which is the atomic number (Z). Neutral atoms have the same number of electrons and protons. Atoms of an element that contain different numbers of neutrons are called isotopes. Each isotope of a given element has the same atomic number but a different mass number (A), which is the sum of the numbers of protons and neutrons. The relative masses of atoms are reported using the atomic mass unit (amu), which is defined as one-twelfth of the mass of one atom of carbon-12, with 6 protons, 6 neutrons, and 6 electrons.
