Physicist J. J. Thompson proved that atoms aren't the most basic form of matter through his discovery of electrons, and he suggested that they were fundamental components of all atoms.

Ernest Rutherford showed that compounds of uranium and other elements emitted at least two discict types of radiation

$\alpha$ (alpha) particles were the first type of radiation to be discovered. They had a positive charge and was readily absorbed by matter

$\beta$ (beta) particles were the second type of radiation to be discovered. They had the same mass-to-charge ratio as electrons. 

$\gamma$ (gamma) rays were the third type of radiation to be discovered and were found to be similar to x-rays.

$\alpha$ particles have the least penetrating power and are stopped by a sheet of paper, whereas $\beta$ particles can pass through thin sheets of metal but are absorbed by lead foil or even thick glass. In contrast, $\gamma$-rays can readily penetrate matter; thick blocks of lead or concrete are needed to stop them.

Scientists concluded that atoms were neutral and J. J. Thompson proposed that the electrons he discovered were embedded in a uniform sphere that contained the positive charge and most of the mass of an atom. He visualized this with his "Plum pudding model"

This visual was later proven wrong by Rutherford's gold foil experiment.

- Electron - has a mass number of 0 and a charge of -1
- Proton - has a mass number of 1 and a charge of +1
- Neutron - has a mass number of 1 and a charge of 0
- Nucleus - contains all of the protons and neutrons. Very small and very dense.

Atoms are the ultimate building blocks of all matter. The modern atomic theory establishes the concepts of atoms and how they compose matter. Atoms, the smallest particles of an element that exhibit the properties of that element, consist of negatively charged electrons around a central nucleus composed of more massive positively charged protons and electrically neutral neutrons. Radioactivity is the emission of energetic particles and rays (radiation) by some substances. Three important kinds of radiation are α particles (helium nuclei), β particles (electrons traveling at high speed), and γ rays (similar to x-rays but higher in energy).
