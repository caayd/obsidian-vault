John Dalton is the scientist credited fro proposing the atomic theory. The theories that he used as a basis for his theory: (1)<span style="color:#00b050"> Law of Conservation of Mass</span>, (2) Law of Definite Proportions, and (3) Law of Multiple Proportions.

<span style="color:#ffc000"><u>Law 1: The Conservation of Mass</u></span>

"What exists now has always existed"

This law states that **the atoms of an object cannot be created or destroyed, but can be moved around and be changed into different particles.**

When a chemical reaction rearranges atoms into a new product, the mass of the reactants is the same as the mass of the products. "Whatever you do, you will have the same amount of stuff"

mass is conserved.

<span style="color:#ffc000"><u>Law 2: Definite Proportions</u></span>

This law states that **if a compound is broken down into its constituent elements, the masses of the constituents will always have the same proportions, regardless of the quantity or source of the original substance.**

<span style="color:#808080">If 1 gram of A reacts with 8 grams of B, then by the Law of Definite Proportions, 2 grams of A must react with 16 grams of B.</span>

The Law of Definite Proportions only applies when elements are reacted together to form the same product.

<span style="color:#ffc000"><u>Law 3: Multiple Proportions</u></span>

The law of multiple proportions states that if two elements form more than one compound between them, the masses of one element combined with a fixed mass of the second element form in ratios of small integers. These ratios will always be <u>whole numbers</u>.

</span>

1. All matter consists of indivisible particles called atoms.
2. Atoms of the same element are similar in shape and mass, but differ from the atoms of other elements.
3. Atoms cannot be created or destroyed.
4. Atoms of different elements may combine with each other in a fixed, simple, whole number ratios to form compound atoms.
5. Atoms of same element can combine in more than one ratio to form two or more compounds.
6. The atom is the smallest unit of matter that can take part in a chemical reaction.

This theory had a few drawbacks with some aspects being proven wrong, however proved to be very important to chemistry.
