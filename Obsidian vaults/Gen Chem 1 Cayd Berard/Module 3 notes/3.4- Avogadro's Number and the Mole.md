The molecular mass of a substance is the sum of the average masses of the atoms in one molecule of a substance. It is calculated by adding together the atomic masses of the elements in the substance, each multiplied by its subscript (written or implied) in the molecular formula.

Because the units of atomic mass are atomic mass units, the units of molecular mass are also atomic mass units.

Ionic compounds do not have a readily identifiable molecular unit, so instead the formula mass (aka empirical formula mass) of the compound is used instead of molecular mass.

<u>Formula mass</u>: is the sum of the atomic masses of all the elements in the empirical formula, each multiplied by its subscript. It is directly analogous to the molecular mass of a covalent compound. The units are atomic mass units.

Because the masses of individual atoms are so minuscule (on the order of 10−23 g/atom), chemists do not measure the mass of individual atoms or molecules.

To analyze the transformations that occur between individual atoms or molecules in a chemical reaction, it is therefore essential for chemists to know how many atoms or molecules are contained in a measurable quantity in the laboratory—a given mass of sample. The unit that provides this link is the mole (mol).

Any readily measurable mass of an element or compound contains an extraordinarily large number of atoms, molecules, or ions, so an extremely large numerical unit is needed to count them. The mole is used for this purpose.

A mole is the amount of a substance that contains the number of carbon atoms in exactly 12 g of isotopically pure carbon-12.

This mass is 6.022142 $\times$ 10<sup>23</sup> atoms, but 6.022 $\times$ 10<sup>23</sup> provides a sufficient number of sig figs. This number is called Avogadro's number.

1 mole of carbon, or of literally <u>anything</u> else always has the same number of objects: 6.022 $\times$ 10<sup>23</sup>. Similar to how a dozen of something is always 12.

Because of the way the mole is defined, for every element the number of grams in a mole is the same as the number of atomic mass units in the atomic mass of the element.

The molar mass of a substance is defined as the mass in grams of 1 mole of that substance. One mole of isotopically pure carbon-12 has a mass of 12 g.

For an element the molar mass is the mass of 1 mol of atoms of that element; for a covalent molecular compound, it is the mass of 1 mol of molecules of that compound; for an ionic compound, it is the mass of 1 mol of formula units.

The molar mass of a substance is the mass (in grams per mole) of 6.022 $\times$ 10<sup>23</sup> atoms, molecules, or formula units of that substance. In each case, the number of grams in 1 mol is the same as the number of atomic mass units that describe the atomic mass, the molecular mass, or the formula mass, respectively.

<u>The molar mass of any substance is its atomic mass, molecular mass, or formula mass in grams per mole.</u>

|Substance (formula)|Atomic, Molecular, or Formula Mass(amu)|Molar Mass (g/mol)|
|---|---|---|
|carbon (C)|12.011 (atomic mass)|12.011|
|ethanol (C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>5</sub>OH) |46.069 (molecular mass)|46.069|
|calcium phosphate [Ca<sub>3</sub>(PO<sub>4</sub>)<sub>2</sub>] |310.177 (formula mass)|310.177|
to convert moles of a substance to mass, the following relationship is used:

$(moles)\times(molar~mass)\rightarrow grams$

specifically,

$\cancel{moles} \times(\dfrac{grams}{\cancel{moles}})=grams$

to convert the mass of a substance to moles:

$(\dfrac{grams}{molar~mass})\rightarrow moles$

$(\dfrac{grams}{grams/mole})=\cancel{grams}(\dfrac{mole}{\cancel{grams}})=moles$

<span style="color:#00b0f0"><u>Summary</u></span> 

To analyze chemical transformations, it is essential to use a standardized unit of measure called the mole. The molecular mass and the formula mass of a compound are obtained by adding together the atomic masses of the atoms present in the molecular formula or empirical formula, respectively; the units of both are atomic mass units (amu). The mole is a unit used to measure the number of atoms, molecules, or (in the case of ionic compounds) formula units in a given mass of a substance. The mole is defined as the amount of substance that contains the number of carbon atoms in exactly 12 g of carbon-12, Avogadro’s number (6.022 × 1023) of atoms of carbon-12. The molar mass of a substance is defined as the mass of 1 mol of that substance, expressed in grams per mole, and is equal to the mass of 6.022 × 1023 atoms, molecules, or formula units of that substance.
