<span style="color:#00b0f0"><u>Empirical Formulas</u></span> 
An empirical formula tells us the relative ratios of different atoms in a compound. The ratios hold true on the <u>molar</u> level as well.

If a compound's chemical formula cannot be reduced any more, then the empirical formula is the same as the chemical formula.

H<sub>2</sub>O is composed of two atoms of hydrogen and 1 atom of oxygen. Likewise, 1.0 mole of H<sub>2</sub>O is composed of 2.0 moles of hydrogen and 1.0 mole of oxygen.

<u>if we know the molar amounts of each element in a compound we can determine the empirical formula.</u>

You can obtain the chemical formula from the empirical formula if you know the molecular weight of the compound.

<u>The chemical formula will always be some integer multiple of the empirical formula.</u>

One of the most common ways to determine the elemental composition of an unknown hydrocarbon is an analytical procedure called combustion analysis.
