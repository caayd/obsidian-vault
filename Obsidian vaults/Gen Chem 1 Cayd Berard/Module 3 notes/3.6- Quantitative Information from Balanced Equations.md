<u>Stoichiometry</u> - a collective term for the quantitative relationships between the masses, the numbers of moles, and the numbers of particles (atoms, molecules, and ions) of the reactants and the products in a balanced chemical equation.

<u>Stoichiometric quantity</u> - the amount of product or reactant specified by the coefficients in a balanced chemical equation.

1. Convert the mass of one substance (substance A) to the corresponding number of moles using its molar mass.

2. From the balanced chemical equation, obtain the number of moles of another substance (B) from the number of moles of substance A using the appropriate mole ratio (the ratio of their coefficients).

3. Convert the number of moles of substance B to mass using its molar mass. It is important to remember that some species are present in excess by virtue of the reaction conditions. For example, if a substance reacts with the oxygen in air, then oxygen is in obvious (but unstated) excess.

Quantitative calculations involving reactions in solution are carried out with <u>masses</u>, however, <u>volumes</u> of solutions of known concentration are used to determine the number of moles of reactants.

The balanced chemical equation for a reaction and either the masses of solid reactants and products or the volumes of solutions of reactants and products can be used in stoichiometric calculations.

Either the masses or the volumes of solutions of reactants and products can be used to determine the amounts of other species in the balanced chemical equation. Quantitative calculations that involve the stoichiometry of reactions in solution use volumes of solutions of known concentration instead of masses of reactants or products. The coefficients in the balanced chemical equation tell how many moles of reactants are needed and how many moles of product can be produced.
