A <u>chemical equation</u> is an expression that gives the identities and quantities of the substances in a chemical reaction.

Ex: Hydrogen gas can react with oxygen gas to form water, this is written as:

$2~H_{2}+O_{2} \rightarrow~2~H_{2}O$

<u>The starting materials are called reactants</u> and are written on the left side of the equation, <u>the final compounds are called products</u> and are written on the right of the arrow. $reactants \rightarrow products$ 

The arrow is read ad "yields" or "reacts to form."

There are abbreviations often used: (s) for solid, (l) for liquid, (g) for gas, and (aq) for aqueous solution, a solution of the substance in water.

Consistent with the law of conservation of mass, the numbers of each type of atom are the same on both sides of the equations.

In a balanced chemical equation, both the numbers of each type of atom and the total charge are the same on both side. **The only difference on each side of the equation is how the atoms are arranged to make molecules or ions.**

**A chemical reaction represents a change in the distribution of atoms, but not the in the number of atoms.**

In most chemical reactions, bonds are broken in the reactants, and new bonds are formed to create the products.

If the numbers of each type of atom are different on the two sides of a chemical equation, then the equation is unbalanced, and it can't correctly describe what happens during the reaction.

A chemical equation <u>must be balanced.</u>

You cannot change subscripts in a chemical formula to balance a chemical equation; you can only change the coefficients.

The simplest and most generally useful method for balancing chemical equations is "inspection," better known as trial and error. Steps:

- Identify the most complex substance.
- Starting with that substance, choose an element that appears in only one reactant and product if possible. Adjust the coefficients to obtain the same number of atoms of the element on both sides.
- Balance polyatomic ions (if present) as a unit.
- Balance remaining atoms, usually ending with the least complex substance and using fractional coefficients if necessary. If a fractional coefficient has been used, multiply both sides of the equation by the denominator to obtain whole numbers for the coefficients.
- Check work by counting the numbers of atoms of each kind on both sides of the equation to make sure the equation is balanced.

A balanced chemical equation also gives the relative amounts of reactants and products consumed or produced in a reaction. 

The number of atoms, molecules, or formula units of a reactant or a product in a balanced chemical equation is the coefficient (ex: the 4 in 4H<sub>2</sub>O). If there is no coefficient, the coefficient is assumed to be 1.

The ratio of the number of moles of one substance to the number of moles of another is called the <u>mole ratio.</u> (ex: In the image above, the mole ratio of H<sub>2</sub>O to N<sub>2</sub> is 4:1).

The total mass of reactants equals the total mass of products, as predicted by Dalton’s law of conservation of mass:

252g of (NH<sub>4</sub>)<sub>2</sub>Cr<sub>2</sub>O<sub>7</sub>   yields   158 + 28 + 72 = 252 g of products.

The chemical reaction does not show the rate of reaction at all, or whether energy in the form of heat or light is given off.

A chemical reaction is described by a chemical equation that gives the identities and quantities of the reactants and the products. In a chemical reaction, one or more substances are transformed to new substances. A chemical reaction is described by a chemical equation, an expression that gives the identities and quantities of the substances involved in a reaction. A chemical equation shows the starting compound(s)—the reactants—on the left and the final compound(s)—the products—on the right, separated by an arrow. In a balanced chemical equation, the numbers of atoms of each element and the total charge are the same on both sides of the equation. The number of atoms, molecules, or formula units of a reactant or product in a balanced chemical equation is the coefficient of that species. The mole ratio of two substances in a chemical reaction is the ratio of their coefficients in the balanced chemical equation.
