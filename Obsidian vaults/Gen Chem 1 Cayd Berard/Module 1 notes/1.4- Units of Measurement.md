Most of the physical quantities we actually deal with in science and also in our daily lives, have units of their own: volume, pressure, energy and electrical resistance are some to name a few.

All of these can be expressed in terms of the SI base units; they are consequently known as <u>derived units</u>. Most physical quantities can be expressed in terms of one or more of the following five fundamental units:
- mass (M)
- length (L)
- time (T)
- electric charge (Q)
- temperature ($\theta$ theta)

$V = x \times y \times z$ 

therefore, volume has the dimensions of length-cubed:

$dim${$V$} $= L^{3}$

Mass $\neq$ Weight

Pressure is the measure of the _force_ exerted on a unit area of surface. Its SI units are therefore newtons per square meter, but we make such frequent use of pressure that a derived SI unit, the _<u>pascal</u>, is commonly used:

$1\:Pa = 1\:N\:m^{-2}$
