## Main Ideas
---

Internet is rapidly taking over and wiping out our old preservation of knowledge such as books, magazines, and images with many believing that the containments of these forms of media are already stored online. This is not true however and this amount of trust is extremely dangerous as we could lose a lot of our past.

While there are some people making valiant efforts to preserve and upload our "history" to the Internet, we are still losing information at a rapid rate and it is something that needs to be acted upon


## Timeline Breakdown
---

1:30 - Dennis Wingo from McMoon says that everyday we create large amouts of data and put it online

2:54 - Hans van Hartevelt, director at KIT library, whose library was getting cleared out stated that "They all think wrongly: Everything's available online" (3:48).

4:52 -  "are we so perfect that we cant learn anything from the past anymore"

7:48 - Brewster Kahle founder of *internet archive* is making moves to digitize everything, with hopes that it can be looked bak upon in the future.

8:50 - Kahle states that the archive is about 15 petabytes of data. (1 petabyte = 1000 terabytes)

10:00 - Kahle states the archive started by archiving websites all over the internet and that it now consists of 380 billion pages, with them collecting around a billion pages a week. (Pages go to the *WayBack Machine*)

10:33 - Brewster Kahle founder of *Internet Archive* states that if we "lose the past," anyone who controls whats being put out will essentially be in charge of whats true or not.

13:06 - Ismail Serageldin, director at the Library of Alexandria, explains why libraries are still crucial. stating its a place where people can learn about their past, and get the tools to invent the new.

16:03 - Serageldin states, "it is a shame when books become only artifacts, rather than living pieces of our memories and the living contribution of someone who is no longer with us but who can still impart his or her wisdom to next generations through the vehicle of the book"

21:49 - Dennis Wingo, a space engineer, explains how we spend billions of dollars to capture footage of the moon that has now been mostly lost. He further explains that we have less than one percent if the written documents form Rome and that we have less than a half of a percent from Greece, and only .001 percent of Egyptian documents that accumulated over 3000 years.

22:22 - Wingo states that he has 6 hard drives form 1995 and only 3 of them work.

~~Robert Miller, global director of books at the Internet Archive, who is making efforts to digitalize every book in the world states.~~

40:47 - Jason Scott, a digital historian, states that while a lot of data has been saved, the places it has been stored has let to it becoming unreadable. He states that floppy disks are now essentially unreadable as there is no technology that still exists that can read it.

45:22 - narrator states that "...we have outsourced ours memory to corporations without knowing where this free cloud will float to...  "

47:36 - Kahle states that while corporations like Google are scanning books (called Google Books) in a similar way to his "Internet Archive," they are a commercial player which means their intentions may not be as good for as as they appear.

## Points to Cover (Thesis)
---

1. The internet is the best way to do it, however it must be done properly and not many are taking advantage of that. Only a few individuals with truly good intentions have started taking action. 
   Examples: 
	   - Internet Archive's Brewster Kahle and his scanning of books and media + Way back machine.

2. Technology has advanced and made old forms of media obsolete leading to the loss of many saved information. Examples:
	- Dennis Wingo and the loss of NASA space footage due to it being stored on tapes with little to no readers left. 
	- Jason Scott and how Floppy disks can no longer be read,

3. Many large corporations are likely to be untrustworthy as they are commercial and may have bad intentions to profit off of the history.
   Examples: 
	   - Kahle stating that Google is a commercial business.
