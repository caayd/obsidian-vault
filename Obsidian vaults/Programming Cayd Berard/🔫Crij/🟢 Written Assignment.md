Write about the **Anders Behring Breivik attacks on Norway** from the video I watched in English.

Hate crimes - Acts of violence or intimidation designed to terrorize or frighten people considered undesirable because of their race, religion, ethnic origin, or sexual orientation.

## Theories???
*More in CHAPTER 9*
**Social Schematic Theory (SST)** - Created by *Ronald Simons and Callie Burt* states that crime is a result of an individual learning to define situations as requiring or justifying aggression, coercion, or cheating (self justification for crime, delusion). Criminals develop **social schemas** that exclude pertinent information and instead focus only on things that confirm preexisting beliefs and ideas validifying their actions.

Breivik fell into a delusional obsession with his ideas, validifying them inside his mind.
Surrounded himself with likeminded people on the internet justifying his actions and beliefs, as well as holding his obsessions with past dictator like individuals who did the same.
He had spent years developing and working on his plan making it highly likely that this is what led to his actions.
