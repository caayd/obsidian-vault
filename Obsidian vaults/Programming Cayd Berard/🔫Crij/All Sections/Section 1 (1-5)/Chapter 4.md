# The Development of Rational Choice

#### Development of Classical Criminology
During the eighteenth-century Enlightenment period, social philosophers such as Jeremy Bentham (1748–1833) began to embrace the view that human behavior was a result of rational thought processes.

The purpose of law is to produce and support the total happiness of the community it serves. Because punishment is in itself harmful, its existence is justified only if it promises to prevent greater evil than it creates. Punishment, therefore, has four main objectives:
1. To prevent all criminal offenses
2. When it cannot prevent a crime, to convince the offender to commit a less serious crime
3. To ensure that a criminal uses no more force than is necessary
4. To prevent crime as cheaply as possible

#### Cesare Beccaria
The development of rational classical criminology is most closely identified with the thoughts of Italian social philosopher Cesare Beccaria (1738–1794) and his famous treatise “On Crimes and Punishment.”

He suggested that:
- people choose all behavior, including criminal behavior;
- their choices are designed to bring them pleasure and reduce pain;
- criminal choices can be controlled by fear of punishment; and
- the more severe, certain, and swift the punishment, the greater its ability to control criminal behavior.

<u>Marginal deterrence</u> - if petty offenses were subject to the same punishment as more serious crimes, offenders would choose the more serious crime because the resulting punishment would be about the same.

#### Classical Criminology
The writings of Beccaria and his followers form the core of what today is referred to as <u>classical criminology</u>, which consists of several basic elements:
- In every society, people have free will to choose criminal or lawful solutions to meet their needs or settle their problems.
- Criminal solutions can be very attractive because for little effort they hold the promise of a huge payoff.
- A person will choose not to commit crime only if he or she believes that the pain of expected punishment is greater than the promise of reward. This is the principle of deterrence.
- In order to be an effective crime deterrent, punishment must be severe, certain, and swift enough to convince potential criminals that “crime does not pay.”

#### Contemporary Choice Theory Emerges
Beginning in the mid-1970s, there was renewed interest in the classical approach to crime. According to liberal criminology, If crime was caused by some social or psychological problem, such as poverty, then crime rates could be reduced by providing good jobs and economic opportunities.

# The Concepts of Rational Choice
<u>Rational choice theory</u>  -  Criminal decision making is rational and coherent, not spontaneous or impulsive. The decision to commit crime is shaped by human emotions and thought processes, influenced by social relationships, individual traits and capabilities, and environmental characteristics.

#### Why Crime?
The core premise of rational choice theory is that people will choose crime if the circumstances are right: <u>great reward with little risk</u>. For some people choosing crime can bring desired social, economic, and psychic benefits; it can be a good choice despite its consequences, such as teens committing crime to achieve a sense of control or mastery over their environment or to pay for drugs and alcohol.

#### Choosing Crime
Even those who decide to enter a criminal way of life do not commit crime all the time, they may go to school or church.

Before choosing to commit a crime, reasoning criminals evaluate the risk of apprehension, the seriousness of expected punishment, the potential value of the criminal enterprise, and their immediate need for criminal gain; their behavior is systematic and selective (assure themselves that what they do is worth the risk).

#### Offense and Offender
Rational choice theorists view crime as both offense- and offender-specific.

<u>Offense-specific crime</u> - Offenders will react selectively to the characteristics of an individual criminal act. For example, a criminal making the decision to commit a burglary may go through the though process:
- Evaluation the target yield
- Probability of security devices
- Ease of escape
- Entry points and exits, etc.

<u>Offender-specific crime</u> - Criminals are not robots who engage in unthinking, unplanned random acts of antisocial behavior. Before deciding to commit crime, individuals must decide whether they have the prerequisites to commit a successful criminal act. This might include evaluation of:
- Whether they possess the necessary skills to commit the crime
- Their immediate need for money or other valuables
- Whether legitimate financial alternatives to crime exist, such as a high-paying job
- Whether they have available resources to commit the crime

#### Structuring Criminality
The decision to commit crime is shaped by both personal factors and situational conditions. Time, place, audience, guardianship, and other factors all play a role in criminal decision making.

- <u>Peers and Guardianship</u> - Monitoring by parents reduces the likelihood kids will commit crime; hanging out with adolescent friends increases the risk.

 - <u>Excitement and Thrills</u> - Some criminal offenders may engage in illegal behavior because they love the excitement and thrills that crime can provide.

 - <u>Economic Opportunity</u> - Some people may engage in criminal activity simply because they need the money to support their lifestyle and perceive few other potential income sources.

- <u>Learning and Experience</u> - Learning and experience may be important elements in structuring the choice of crime. Experienced criminals may turn from a life of crime when they develop a belief that the risk of crime is greater than its potential profit.

- <u>Knowledge of Criminal Techniques</u> - Criminals report learning techniques that help them avoid detection, a sure sign of rational thinking and planning. Some are specialists who learn to be professional car thieves or bad-check artists.

#### Structuring Crime
Criminal decision making is not only based on an assessment of personal needs and capabilities but also on a rational assessment of the criminal event. Decisions must be made about what, where, when, and whom to target.

- <u>Choosing the Type of Crime</u> - The choice of crime may be dictated by market conditions. Generalists may alter their criminal behavior according to shifting opportunity structures. For example, they may rob the elderly on the first of the month when they know that Social Security checks have been cashed.
- <u>Choosing the Time and Place of Crime</u> - There is also evidence that criminal choice is structured by the time and place. For example, some burglars find out which families have star high school athletes because those that do are sure to be at the weekend game, leaving their houses unguarded. 
- <u>Selecting the Target of Crime</u> - Criminals may also be well aware of target vulnerability. When they choose targets, they may shy off if they sense danger.

# Is Crime Rational
It is relatively easy to show that some crimes are the product of rational, objective thought, especially when they involve an ongoing criminal conspiracy centered on economic gain.

#### Is Theft Rational?
Some common theft-related crimes—larcenies, shoplifting, auto theft, purse snatchings—seem more likely to be random acts of criminal opportunity than well-thought-out conspiracies. However, there is evidence of heavy planning and strategy that goes into these acts.

#### Is Drug use Rational?
Research does in fact show that from its onset drug use is controlled by rational decision making. Users report that they begin taking drugs when they believe that the benefits of substance abuse outweigh its costs (e.g., they believe that drugs will provide a fun, exciting, thrilling experience). Drug dealers also make rational decisions on who to sell to as more vulnerable/gullible customers can be sold to for more profit.

#### Is Violence Rational?
There are a number of indicators that suggest violence has rational elements.

Crime expert Richard Felson argues that violence is a matter of choice and serves specific goals:
- Control. The violent person may want to control his or her victim’s behavior and life.
- <u>Retribution</u>. The perpetrator may want punish someone without calling the police or using the justice system to addres<u></u>s his or her grievances. The person takes the law into his or her own hands.
- <u>Deterrence</u>. The attacker may want to stop someone from repeating acts that he or she considers hostile or provocative.
- <u>Reputation</u>. An attack may be motivated by the need to enhance reputation and create self-importance in the eyes of others.

##### Rationality of other crimes
- <u>Thieves</u> - Robbers and burglars display rationality in their choice of targets.
	- Burglars like to target residences close to where they live so they know the territory and have access to escape routes.
	- Street robbers are likely to choose victims who are vulnerable, have low coercive power, and do not pose any threat.
- <u>Killers</u> - Even in apparently senseless killings among strangers, the conscious motive is typically revenge for a prior dispute or disagreement among the parties involved or their families. Although some killings are the result of anger and aggression, others are the result of rational planning.
- <u>Sex Criminals</u> -  Serial rapists rationally choose their targets. They travel, on average, three miles from their homes to commit their crimes in order to avoid victims who might recognize them later. Younger sex offenders create scripts that guide their interactions with victims. If they follow the script, they can commit their crimes and avoid detection.
- <u>Hate Crimes</u> - When anger and prejudice drive retaliatory hate crimes they dissipate quickly. Hate crimes, then, are not merely the product of a disturbed mind, but rather a calculated response to a concrete event whose impact is often fanned and inflamed by the media.

# Eliminating Crime
Crime can be controlled or eradicated by convincing potential offenders that:
- Crime is a poor choice that will not bring them rewards, but instead lead to hardship and deprivation.
- Crime is not worth the effort. It is easier to work at a legitimate job than to evade police, outwit alarms, and avoid security.
- Crime brings pain that is not easily forgotten. People who experience the pains of punishment will not readily commit more crimes.

# Situational Crime Prevention

<u>Situational crime prevention</u> - a concepts that states that criminal acts will be avoided if:
- potential targets are guarded securely,
- the means to commit crime are controlled, and
- potential offenders are carefully monitored.

<u>Defensible space</u> -  crime can be prevented or displaced through the use of residential architectural designs that reduce criminal opportunity, such as well-lit housing projects that maximize surveillance.

#### Targeting Specific Crimes
Typically, situational crime prevention efforts are divided into a number of strategies:
- <u>Increase the effort</u> needed to commit crime
- <u>Reduce the opportunity</u> to commit crime
- <u>Increase the risks</u> of committing crime
- <u>Reduce the rewards</u> for committing crime
- <u>Reduce provocation/induce guilt or shame</u> for committing crime
- <u>Reduce excuses</u> for committing crime

#### Situational Crime Prevention: Costs and Benefits
Benefits of situational crime control efforts:
- <u>Diffusion</u> -  Sometimes efforts to prevent one crime help prevent another; in other instances, crime control efforts in one locale reduce crime in surrounding areas.
- <u>Discouragement</u> - When protection efforts become effective, potential criminals may become discouraged causing criminals to leave the area or seek other methods of gaining financial rewards.

Costs that limit the effectiveness of these efforts:
- <u>Displacement</u> - A program that seems successful because it helps lower crime rates at specific locations or neighborhoods may simply be redirecting offenders to alternative targets.
- <u>Extinction</u> - Sometimes crime reduction programs may produce a short-term positive effect, but benefits dissipate as criminals adjust to new conditions.
- <u>Encouragement</u> - Crime reduction programs may boomerang and increase rather than decrease the potentiality for crime.

# General Deterrence
<u>General deterrence theory</u> - states that crime can be controlled by the threat and/or application of criminal punishment.

If people fear being apprehended and punished, being locked up in a harsh prison, or even sentenced to death, they will not risk breaking the law.

#### The Perception of Punishment and Deterrence
<u>Perceptual deterrence</u> - people who feel threatened, who believe they will get caught and punished, will be deterred from committing crime even if the true likelihood of detection and punishment is insignificant.

#### Certainty of Punishment and Deterrence
If punishment were both certain and imminent, even the most motivated criminal would desist because the risks of crime outweigh its rewards.

#### Severity of Punishment and Deterrence
According to general deterrence theory, as the severity of punishment increases, crime rates should decrease.  There have been mixed result as to whether or not this holds true.

People who are afraid that significant others—such as parents, peers, neighbors, and teachers—will disapprove of their behavior are less likely to commit crime.

While shame can be a potent deterrent, offenders also seem to be influenced by forgiveness and acceptance. They are less likely to repeat their criminal activity if victims are willing to grant them forgiveness.

#### Speed (Celerity) of Punishment and Deterrence
 The faster punishment is applied and the more closely it is linked to the crime, the more likely it will serve as a deterrent. A criminal who is apprehended, tried, and convicted soon after committing a crime will be more deeply affected than one who experiences a significant delay between crime and punishment.

#### Analyzing General Deterrence
While the threat of legal punishment should, on the face of it, deter lawbreakers through fear, there is little evidence that the fear of apprehension and punishment alone can reduce crime rates.

- Rationality - In many instances, criminals are desperate people who suffer from personality disorders that impair their judgment and render them incapable of making truly rational decisions.
- Compulsion - Many offenders act compulsively and are therefore unlikely to be deterred by the future threat of punishment (ie. sex offenders).
- Need - Many offenders are members of the underclass—people cut off from society, lacking the education and skills they need to be in demand in the modern economy.
- Greed - Some may be immune to deterrent effects because they believe the profits from crime are worth the risk of punishment; it may be their only significant chance for gain and profit.

# Specific Deterrence
<u>Specific deterrence theory</u> (also called special or particular deterrence) - states that after experiencing criminal sanctions that are swift, sure, and powerful, known criminals will never dare repeat their criminal acts.

While general deterrence relies on the perception of future punishments, specific deterrence relies on its <u>application</u>.

In principle, punishment works if a connection can be established between the planned action and memories of its consequence; if these recollections are adequately intense, the action will be unlikely to occur again.

#### Can Punishment Produce more Crime?
In some instances, rather than reducing the frequency of crime, severe punishments may actually increase reoffending rates. There are many reasons why this could be:
- Offenders may believe they have learned from their experiences, and now know how to beat the system and get away with crime.
- Severely punished offenders may represent the “worst of the worst,” who will offend again no matter what punishments they experience.
- People who are harshly treated may want to show that they cannot be broken by the system.
- Harsh treatment labels and stigmatizes offenders, locking them into a criminal career.
- Criminals who are punished may also believe that the likelihood of getting caught twice for the same type of crime is remote.

# Incapacitation
 <u>Incapacitation effect theory</u> - It stands to reason that if more criminals are sent to prison, the crime rate should go down. Because most people age out of crime, the duration of a criminal career is limited.

#### Does Incarceration Control Crime?
The fact that crime rates have dropped while the prison population has boomed supports incapacitation as an effective crime control policy.

# Public Policy Implications of Choice Theory

#### Police and Deterrence
 There has been some recent evidence indicating that adding to police patrol forces does in fact help reduce crime rates and that police are a more effective deterrent than toughening sentences or putting people in prison.

#### Courts, Sentencing, and Deterrence
While a policy of placing people convicted of a third felony behind bars for life is politically compelling, many criminologists believe these laws are ineffective and will create a growing population of expensive to maintain elderly inmates who committed relatively minor crimes.

#### Just Desert
<u>Just desert</u> - states that those who violate the rights of others deserve to be punished. The severity of punishment should be commensurate with the seriousness of the crime.
