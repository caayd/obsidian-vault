Walmart documentary (important timestamps and notes)

### Notes


## Reasons against Walmart (thesis):
- It kills local/family business (low prices tied w bigger name kill any competition) [[#<u>Kills Local Business</u>|1]]
- poor living conditions for workers (barely any, if not no, money to live) [[#<u>Poor living conditions for the workers</u>|2]]
- low prices come from taxpayer money (less money spent paying workers)
- corrupt leaders and policies (preventing unions, cheating overtime) [[#<u>Corrupt practices </u>|3]]
- lots of evidence of sexual and racial discrimination




Every ad portrays a positive image, however, reality is complete opposite.

## <u>Kills Local Business</u>
-  Begins in a small town named Middlefield where a hardware store (H&H hardware) is facing the effect of Walmart on their town
	- when the owner of the store (named John Hunter) was getting his building appraised, the appraised gave a much lower than expected value and stated that: "anytime a Walmart is coming to a town, they knock the values down because sooner or later there's going to be a bunch of empty buildings and none of them are going to be able to sell" (00:10:56-00:11:07). 
	- H&H hardware had to close after 43 years of business due to a Walmart entering town (seen @ 00:11:45)

## <u>Poor living conditions for the workers</u>
- They keep the number of employees low to increase profits leading to workers being over-worked. <u>They don't care about the workers, only the profits</u>
	- The workers are given poor health care benefits/plans/insurance.
	- A Walmart store manager trainer (17 years at the company) made a claim about the workers: 
		- "No matter what anybody says, they are at poverty level. I watched so many people go without lunch in the lounges that I stopped eating in the lounges..." (00:19:59-00:20:07).
		- "There was people I would see that didn't eat nothing. They would take an hour lunch and just sit there." 
		  
	- A previous worker states "Its pretty bad when you need to tell your employees that all these programs are available for you because we're not paying you enough money" (00:21:43-00:21:54).
	
	Many workers have to work full-time in order to actually be able to provide/meet expectations due to lack of employees and are payed poverty-level wages. [[#^685503|relevant quote]]
	
	Walmart uses the government to provide livable conditions for their workers instead of paying them enough money to live.
	
	<u>Low prices come form taxpayer money</u>

## <u>Corrupt practices:</u> 
They shut down any attempt to protest or form a union.
	Examples (32:40)
	- $7000 anti union camera package per store
	- $30,000 undercover spy van per store
	- $100,000 24 hour anti-union hotline
	- $7,000,000 rapid response team with corporates jet

issue of forming union and worker rights only prevalent in the US (33:25).

Manager trainer claimed: "I've seen go in when someone worked 41 or 42 hours and change it to 40 hours" (37:01-37:08).


## <u>Lesser reasons</u>
- Walmart ends up getting a majority of government money form subsidies that could be going to better causes.

- Whenever a Walmart decides to shut down in a specific area, they leave a very large and expensive building that most businesses cannot fill, leading it to sit there for years, taking up space that could be used for literally anything else (54:08-54:30).

- Lack of care for the environment, multiple times (59:42-1:00:09).

- abusing factory workers in other countries.

- lack of security in parking lots leading to high crime rates.
	- Along with lack of care for employees, there is also a lack of care for the customers. Walmart only cares about the customer until they have purchased their items and left the store. <u>Profits before safety</u> (1:24:09-1:24:17).

### Timestamps and quotes
- "Walmart drives down Retail Wages $3 Billion Every Year" (00:15:14-?)
- A store manager claimed: "Our district manager actually explained to us how to cheat workers out of overtime...He explained to us how to in the system under a false user id to get into the computer and move that time to the next week." (36:37-37:00).
- Loss prevention manager claims: "as a store manager, you're responsible for reducing your expenses every single month, and the only way to do that is to keep the associates numbers down." (37:53-38:04). ^685503
- In 2004, Walmart employees gave over $5 million to help fellow workers, whilst the Walton family (Walmart's Owner) only gave $6,000 (1:15:57).

"American labor laws allow Walmart ample opportunities to crack down on organizing, from holding mandatory anti-union meetings to illegally firing union activists, with little risk of anything more than a slap-onthe-wrist fine and being required to post a notice promising not to break the law in the future" (Eidelson pg. 1 para. 5).
