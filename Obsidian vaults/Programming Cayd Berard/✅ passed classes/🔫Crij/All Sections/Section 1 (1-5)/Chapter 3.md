# Problems of Crime Victims

The National Crime Victimization Survey (NCVS) indicates that 20 million theft and violence victimizations occur each year.

##### Economic Costs
When the costs of goods taken during property crimes is added to productivity losses caused by injury, pain, and emotional trauma, the cost of victimization is estimated to be in the hundreds of billions of dollars.

Costs include:
- Victim Costs
- Criminal Justice System costs
- Crime Career Costs
- Intangible Costs

Mark Cohen suggests that the typical career criminal causes $1.3 to $1.5 million in external costs; a heavy drug user, $370,000 to $970,000; and a crime-committing dropout, $243,000 to $388,000.

#### Individual Costs
In addition to these societal costs, victims may suffer long-term losses in earnings and occupational attainment (such as medical bills from injuries).

Individuals may suffer from:
- Vicarious Fear
- Suffering Stress
- Adolescent Stress
- Relationship Stress
- Fear


#### Cycle of Violence
Victimization also increases the chance of getting involved in antisocial behavior; violence begets violence.

<u>Cycle of violence phenomenon</u> - states that people who are the victims of violence and abuse in adolescence are more likely to later engage in violent behavior as adults; victims of sexual abuse may often grow up to be sexual offenders themselves.

##### Correlation b/w Victimization and Crime
- Victimization causes social problems.
- Victimization causes stress and anger.
- Victimization prompts revenge.

# The Nature of Victimization
20 million criminal victimizations now occur each year, which is almost a 20-year decline in criminal victimization from a peak of more than 40 million reported victimizations in 1995.

#### The Social Ecology of Victimization
Violent victimization is more likely to take place in an open, public area during the daytime or early evening hours than in a private home during the morning or late evening hours. The more serious violent crimes, such as rape and aggravated assault, typically take place after 6 p.m.

<u>Schools</u>
The latest data available from the National Center for Educational Statistics found that among students ages 12 to 18, there were about 1,421,000 nonfatal victimizations at school.

#### The Victim’s Household
The NCVS tells us that within the United States, larger homes, African American homes, urban homes, and those in the West are the most vulnerable to crime, while rural homes, white homes, and those in the Northeast are the least likely to contain crime victims or be the target of theft offenses.

#### Victim Characteristics
- <u>Gender</u> - Men are almost twice as likely as women to experience robbery. Women, however, are six times more likely than men to be victims of rape, domestic violence, and sexual assault.
- <u>Sexual Orientation</u> - The NCVS data shows that members of the lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, and queer (LGBTQ) community are much more likely to become crime victims than people who are cisgender.
- <u>Age</u> - Victim risk diminishes rapidly after age 25: teens 16 to 19 suffer 45 violent crimes per 1,000, whereas people over 65 experience only 2 per 1,000.
- <u>Social Status</u> - The poorest Americans are also the most likely victims of violent and property crime (ie. homeless people suffer from high rates of assault).
- <u>Marital Status</u> - Divorce claims about half of all first marriages and domestic violence is a significant social problem, however this doesn't effect all married people.
- <u>Race and Ethnicity</u> - African Americans and ethnic minorities are more likely than whites to be victims of violent crime because of income inequality, they end up in areas more susceptible to criminal activity.
- <u>Repeat Victimization</u> - Individuals who have been crime victims have a significantly higher chance of future victimization than people who have not been victims.

#### Victims and Their Criminals
Males are more likely to be violently victimized by a stranger, and females are more likely to be victimized by a friend, an acquaintance, or an intimate.

Crime tends to be intraracial: black offenders victimize blacks, and whites victimize whites. However, because the country’s population is predominantly white, it stands to reason that criminals of all races will be more likely to target white victims.

 More than half of all nonfatal personal crimes are committed by people who are described as being known to the victim.

# Theories of Victimization
 A number of different theories attempt to explain the causes of victimization:

- <u>Victim Precipitation Theory</u> - states that some people may actually initiate the confrontation that eventually leads to their injury or death. Victim precipitation can be either active or passive.
	- Active precipitation - occurs when victims act provocatively, use threats or fighting words, or even attack first.
	- Passive precipitation- occurs when the victim exhibits some personal characteristic that unknowingly either threatens or encourages the attacker.

- <u>Lifestyle Theory</u> - states that people may become crime victims because their risky lifestyle increases their exposure to criminal offenders. Victimization is not a random occurrence but rather a function of the victim’s lifestyle (if you go out a lot late at night you are more susceptible to crime).

- <u>Deviant Place Theory</u> - states that, the greater their exposure to dangerous places, the more likely people will become victims of crime and violence. The more often victims visit high crime areas, the more likely they will be victimized. Deviant places are poor, densely populated, highly transient neighborhoods in which commercial and residential property exist side by side.

- <u>Routine Activities Theory</u> - states that the volume and distribution of predatory crime are closely related to the interaction of three variables that reflect the routine activities of the typical American lifestyle:
	- The availability of<u> suitable targets</u>, such as homes containing easily salable goods
	- The absence of <u>capable guardians</u>, such as police, homeowners, neighbors, friends, parents, and relatives
	- The presence of <u>motivated offenders</u>, such as a large number of unemployed and unsupervised teenagers

# Caring for the Victim
National victim surveys indicate that almost every American age 12 and over will one day become the victim of a common-law crime, such as larceny or burglary, and in the aftermath suffer financial problems, mental stress, and physical hardship.

#### The Government’s Response to Victimization
-  President Ronald Reagan created a <u>Task Force on Victims of Crime</u> in 1982 which suggested that a balance be achieved between recognizing the victim’s rights and providing the defendant with due process.
- The<u> Omnibus Victim and Witness Protection Act</u> was passed, which required the use of victim impact statements at sentencing in federal criminal cases, greater protection for witnesses, more stringent bail laws, and the use of restitution in criminal cases.
- In 1984, the <u>Comprehensive Crime Control Act and the Victims of Crime Act</u> authorized federal funding for state victim compensation and assistance projects.

#### Victim-Offender Reconciliation Programs
<u>Victim-offender reconciliation programs (VORPs)</u> use mediators to facilitate face-to-face encounters between victims and their attackers. The aim is to engage in direct negotiations that lead to <u>restitution agreements</u> and, possibly, reconciliation between the two parties involved.

<u>Victim Impact Statements</u>
Victim impact information is part of the Federal Crime Act of 1994, in which Congress gave federal victims of violent crime or sexual assault the right to speak at sentencing.
This gives the victim an opportunity to tell of his or her experiences and describe the ordeal. In the case of a murder trial, the surviving family can recount the effect the crime has had on their lives and well-being.

#### Community Organization
Citizens have been working independently and in cooperation with local police agencies in neighborhood patrol and block watch programs in which local citizens patrol neighborhoods, watch for suspicious people, help secure the neighborhood, lobby for improvements (such as increased lighting), report crime to police, put out community newsletters, conduct home security surveys, and serve as a source for crime information or tips.

#### Victims and Self-Protection
 The more crime in an area, the greater the amount of fear and the more likely residents will be to engage in self-protective measures. Research indicates that a significant number of crimes may not be reported to police simply because victims prefer to take matters into their own hands.
 - <u>Target hardening</u> - when individuals make their home and business crime proof through locks, bars, alarms, and other devices.

#### Victims’ Rights
More than 30 years ago, legal scholar Frank Carrington suggested that crime victims have legal rights that should assure them of basic services from the government.

Because of the influence of victims’ rights advocates, every state now has a set of legal rights for crime victims in its code of laws, often called a Victims’ Bill of Rights which includes the rights:
- To be notified of proceedings and the status of the defendant
- To be present at criminal justice proceedings
- To make a statement at sentencing and to receive restitution from a convicted offender
- To be consulted before a case is dismissed or a plea agreement is entered
- To a speedy trial
- To keep the victim’s contact information confidential

The European Union member nations have agreed in principle to a set of rules that creates minimum standards for the protection of victims of crime similar to the US's Bill of Rights that help ensure fair treatment of victims.
