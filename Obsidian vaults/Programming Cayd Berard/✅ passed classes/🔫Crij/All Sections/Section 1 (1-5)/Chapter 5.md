# Foundations of Trait Theory

<u>Positivism</u> - branch of social science that uses the scientific method of the natural sciences and suggests that human behavior is a product of social, biological, psychological, or economic forces.

Main elements of positivism:
- All true knowledge is acquired through direct observation and not through conjecture or belief. Statements that cannot be backed up by direct observation are invalid or worthless.
- The scientific method must be used if research findings are to be considered valid, involving steps such as identifying problems, collecting data, forming hypotheses, conducting experiments, and interpreting results.

#### Biological Positivism
Early attempts were made physiognomists and phrenologists including J.K. Lavater, Franz Joseph Gall, and Johann K. Spurzheim to find links between brain formation and criminal behavior. The technology at the time wasn't advanced enough to make any accurate observations but it was the first time the idea of brain structure and criminal behavior was believed to be linked. 

By the early nineteenth century, abnormality in the human mind was being linked to criminal behavior patterns and Philippe Pinel claimed that some people behave abnormally without having mental illness calling it "manie sans delire" (aka. a <u>psychopath</u>).


#### Cesare Lombroso
Cesare Lombroso was an Italian physician who studied the corpses of executed criminals to determine whether law violators were <u>physically</u> different from conventional people.

He believed that criminals were born that way, having inherited a set of primitive physical traits that he called <u>atavistic anomalies</u>.

William Sheldon developed a body build school that showed distinct physiques that criminals manifest making them more susceptible to particular types of antisocial behavior. There were three builds:
- <u>Mesomorphs</u> - have well-developed muscles and an athletic appearance. They are active, aggressive, sometimes violent, and the most likely to become criminals.
- <u>Endomorphs</u> - have heavy builds and are slow moving. They are known for lethargic behavior, rendering them unlikely to commit violent crime and more willing to engage in less strenuous criminal activities such as fencing stolen property.
- <u>Ectomorphs</u> - are tall, thin, and less social and more intellectual than the other types. These types are the least likely to commit crime.

#### The Legacy of Biological Criminology
Strict biological determinism is no longer taken seriously.

<u>Biosocial theory</u> has been made as a term to reflect the assumed link between physical and mental traits, the social environment, and behavior.

#### Sociobiology
<u>Biophobia</u> - the view that no serious consideration should be given to biological factors when attempting to understand human nature.

<u>Sociobiology</u> - created by Edmund O. Wilson, stresses that biological and genetic conditions affect how social behaviors are learned and perceived.

Sociobiologists view the gene as the ultimate unit of life that controls all human destiny.  Although they believe environment and experience also have an impact on behavior, their main premise is that most actions are controlled by a person’s “biological machine,” and that people are controlled by the innate need to have their genetic material survive and dominate others.

#### Contemporary Trait Theories
<u>Trait theory</u> - The view that criminality is a product of abnormal biological and/or psychological traits.

Each offender is considered physically and mentally unique by contemporary trait theorists, with different explanations for each person’s behavior.

<u>Individual vulnerability model</u> - supposes a direct link between traits and crime: some people develop physical or mental conditions at birth, or soon thereafter, that affect their social functioning no matter where they live or how they are raised.

<u>Differential susceptibility model</u> - suggests that there is an indirect association between traits and crime: some people possess physical or mental traits that make them vulnerable to adverse environmental influences.

# Biosocial Theory
Most biocriminologists believe that physical, environmental, and social conditions work in concert to produce human behavior; this is called <u>biosocial theory</u>.

#### Biochemical Conditions and Crime
- <u>Exposure to Smoking and Drinking</u> - Maternal alcohol abuse and/or smoking during gestation have long been linked to prenatal damage and subsequent antisocial behavior in adolescence.

- <u>Exposure to Chemicals and Minerals</u> - Research shows that an over- or undersupply of certain chemicals and minerals such as sodium, mercury, potassium, calcium, amino acids, monoamines, and peptides—can lead to depression, mania, cognitive problems, memory loss, and abnormal sexual activity, all of which have proved to be correlates of crime.

- <u>Diet and Crime</u> - If biochemical makeup can influence behavior, then it stands to reason that food intake and diet are related to crime

- <u>Sugar Intake</u> -  Experiments have been conducted in which children’s diets were altered so that sweet drinks were replaced with fruit juices, table sugar with honey, molasses substituted for sugar in cooking, and so on; results indicate that aggression levels are associated with sugar intake.

- <u>Glucose Metabolism/Hypoglycemia</u> - When the brain is deprived of blood sugar (condition called Hypoglycemia), it has no alternate food supply to call upon, and brain metabolism slows down, impairing function and leading to effects associated with criminal behavior.

- <u>Hormonal Influences</u> - Criminologist James Q. Wilson, in his book The Moral Sense, concludes that hormones, enzymes, and neurotransmitters may be the keys to understanding human behavior helping explain the gender differences in the crime rate. This also helps explain the regional and temporal differences in the crime rate.

- <u>Premenstrual Syndrome</u> - The link between premenstrual syndrome (PMS) and delinquency was first popularized more than 40 years ago by Katharina Dalton, whose studies of English women indicated that females are more likely to commit suicide and be aggressive and otherwise antisocial just before or during menstruation.

- <u>Allergies</u> - Cerebral allergies cause an excessive reaction in the brain, whereas neuroallergies affect the nervous system.  Research indicates a connection between allergies and hyperemotionality, depression, aggressiveness, and violent behavior.

- <u>Environmental Contaminants</u> - Environmental contaminants such as high lead concentration in drinking water has been linked to criminal behavior, as research shows that lead leads to aggression. Economist Rick Nevin found that 65 to 90 percent or more of the substantial variation in violent crime in all of these countries was explained by lead.

#### Neurophysiological Conditions and Crime
<u>Neurophysiology</u> - the study of brain activity,

The association between neurological disorder and antisocial behaviors may take a number of different paths:
- <u>Direct association</u> - Neurological deficits may be a direct cause of antisocial behavior, including violent offending.
- <u>Indirect association</u> - Being in possession of a neurological impairment leads to the development of personality traits that are linked to antisocial behaviors. 
- <u>Interactive cause</u> - Neurological deficits may interact with another trait or social condition to produce antisocial behaviors.

The most important measure of neurophysiological functioning is the <u>electroencephalograph</u> (EEG). It measures brainwaves in cycles per second and studies have found that violent criminals have far higher levels of abnormal EEG recordings than nonviolent or one-time offenders. There are many newer brain scanning techniques that utilize todays technology such as PET scans or BEAM scans as well which make it possible to assess which areas of the brain are directly linked to antisocial behavior.

<u>Executive functioning (EF)</u> - a condition that refers to impairment of the cognitive processes that facilitate the planning and regulation of goal-oriented behavior.

<u>Conduct disorder (CD)</u> -  which is considered a precursor of long-term chronic offending. Children with CD lie, steal, bully other children, get into fights frequently, and break schools’ and parents’ rules; many are callous and lack empathy and/or guilt.

<u>Minimal brain dysfunction (MBD)</u> - an abruptly appearing, maladaptive behavior that interrupts an individual’s lifestyle and life flow. In its most serious form, MBD has been linked to serious antisocial acts, an imbalance in the urge-control mechanisms of the brain, and chemical abnormality.

<u>Learning disability (LD)</u> - a type of MBD, is a disorder in one or more of the basic psychological processes involved in understanding or using spoken or written languages.

Children with ADHD are more likely than non-ADHD youths to use illicit drugs, alcohol, and cigarettes, be physically aggressive, and engage in sex offenses in adolescence.

#### Arousal Theory
<u>Arousal Theory</u> - A view of crime suggesting that people who have a high arousal level seek powerful stimuli in their environment to maintain an optimal level of arousal. These stimuli are often associated with violence and aggression.

The factors that determine a person’s level of arousal are not fully determined, but suspected sources include:
- <u>Brain chemistry (and brain structure)</u> -  Some people have brains with many more nerve cells with receptor sites for neurotransmitters than others.
- <u>Heart rate</u> - Another view is that people with low heart rates are more likely to commit crime because they seek stimulation to increase their feelings of arousal to normal levels.
- <u>Autonomic nervous system</u> - Some biosocial theorists link arousal to the autonomic nervous system as measured by skin conductance response.

#### Genetics and Crime
There are two views of the genetics of crime:
- <u>direct view</u>, in which it is believed that antisocial behavior is inherited, the genetic makeup of parents is passed on to children, and genetic abnormality is directly linked to a variety of antisocial behaviors.
- <u>indirect view</u>, where it is believed that genes are related to some personality or physical trait which in turn is linked to antisocial behavior.

Research does show that if one sibling engages in antisocial behavior, so do his/her brothers and sisters. While there are many factors that shows similarities between siblings' behaviors, there are many reasons that may serve as to why that is.

The genes–crime relationship is controversial because it implies that the propensity to commit crime is present at birth and cannot be altered. However, it is a lasting debate among criminologists.

#### Evolutionary Theory
Some criminologists believe the human traits that produce violence and aggression are produced through the long process of human evolution; This is known as the evolutionary view, and according to it, the competition for scarce resources has influenced and shaped the human species.

#### Evaluation of the Biosocial Branch of Trait Theory
Contemporary biosocial theorists distinguish their views with Lombrosian, deterministic biology. Rather than suggest that there are born criminals and noncriminals, they maintain that some people carry the potential to be violent or antisocial and that environmental conditions can sometimes trigger antisocial responses.

# Psychological Trait Theories
The second branch of trait theories focuses on the psychological aspects of crime, including the associations among intelligence, personality, learning, and criminal behavior.

 Charles Goring studied the mental characteristics of 3,000 English convicts and discovered a significant relationship between crime and a condition he referred to as <u>defective intelligence</u>, involving traits as feeblemindedness, epilepsy, insanity, and defective social instinct.

#### Psychodynamic Theory
Originated by Viennese psychiatrist Sigmund Freud, Psychodynamic (or psychoanalytic) psychology is a prominent segment of psychological theory.

 Contemporary psychodynamic theory places greater emphasis on conscious experience and its interaction with the unconscious, in addition to the role that social factors play in development.

<u>Elements of Psychodynamic Theory</u>
- <u>id</u> -  the primitive part of an individual’s mental makeup present at birth. It represents unconscious biological drives for sex, food, and other life-sustaining necessities. (follows the pleasure principle)
- <u>ego</u> - part of the personality that compensates for the demands of the id by helping the individual guide his or her actions to remain within the boundaries of social convention. (guided by the reality principle)
- <u>superego</u> -  develops as a result of incorporating within the personality the moral standards and values of parents, community, and significant others. It is the moral aspect of an individual’s personality; it passes judgments on behavior.
	**The superego is divided into two parts:**
	-  <u>conscience</u> -  tells what is right and wrong.
	- <u>ego ideal</u> - directs the individual into morally acceptable and responsible behaviors, which may not be pleasurable.

#### Attachment Theory
<u>Attachment theory</u> - The belief that the ability to form attachments—that is, emotionally bond to another person—has important lasting psychological implications that follow people across the life span. Associated with psychologist John Bowlby.

#### Mental Disorders and Crime
Traumatic life events can bring about severe mental disorders that have been linked to the onset of crime and deviance. A more severe mental disorder is referred to as <u>psychosis</u> and is characterized by derangement of personality and loss of contact with reality, thereby causing deterioration of normal social functioning.

Suspected associations between mental illness and crime include the following:
- Mentally ill people may be more likely than the mentally sound to lack financial resources, forcing them to grow up in lower-end neighborhoods with higher crime rates.
- The police may be more likely to arrest the mentally ill, which fosters the impression that they are crime prone.
- Those suffering from mental illness may self-medicate by using illegal substances, a practice linked to criminal behavior.
- People with severe mental illness are more at risk to violent victimization (linked to increased crime rates) than the mentally healthy.

#### Behavioral Theory
<u>Psychological behavior theory</u> - states that human actions are developed through learning experiences. Behavior theorists are concerned with the actual behaviors people engage in during the course of their daily lives. The major premise of this theory is that people alter their behavior according to the reactions it receives from others.

#### Social Learning Theory
part of behavioral branch

<u>Social Learning Theory</u> - argues that people are not actually born with the ability to act violently, but that they learn to be aggressive through their life experiences. 
Social learning theorists view violence as something learned through a process called <u>behavior modeling</u>, in which aggressive acts are usually modeled after <u>three</u> principal sources:
- <u>Family interaction</u> - Studies of family life show that aggressive children have parents who use similar tactics when dealing with others.
- <u>Environmental experiences</u> - People who reside in areas in which violence is a daily occurrence are more likely to act violently than those who dwell in low-crime areas whose norms stress conventional behavior.
- <u>Mass media</u> - Films and television shows commonly depict violence graphically.

#### Cognitive Theory
Pioneered by Wilhelm Wundt, Edward Titchener, and William James. 
Psychologists with a cognitive perspective focus on mental processes and how people perceive and mentally represent the world around them and solve problems.

#### Moral and Intellectual Development Theory
Part of Cognitive branch, hypothesized by Jean Piaget

Revolves around the idea that  people’s reasoning processes develop in an orderly fashion, beginning at birth and continuing into their maturity. 

At first, children respond to the environment in a simple manner, seeking interesting objects and developing their reflexes. By the fourth and final stage, the formal operations stage, they have developed into mature adults who can use logic and abstract thought.

Researchers have continued to show that criminal offenders are more likely to be classified in the lowest levels of moral reasoning (Stages 1 and 2), whereas noncriminals have reached a higher stage of moral development (Stages 3 and 4).

# Personality and Crime
According to this view, the personality is the key to understanding antisocial behavior. The more severe the disorder, the greater the likelihood that the individual will engage in serious and repeated antisocial acts.

#### The Antisocial Personality
Antisocial personality is defined as a pervasive pattern of disregard for, and violation of, the rights of others that begins in childhood or early adolescence and continues into adulthood.
The terms <u>psychopath</u> and <u>sociopath</u> are still commonly used to describe people who have an antisocial personality

#### Intelligence and Crime
<u>Nature theory</u> - intelligence is largely determined genetically, ancestry determines IQ, and low intelligence, as demonstrated by low IQ, is linked to criminal behavior.
<u>Nurture theory</u> -  intelligence must be viewed as partly biological but primarily sociological. Because intelligence is not inherited, low-IQ parents do not necessarily produce low-IQ children.

# Public Policy Implications of Trait Theory
For most of the twentieth century, biological and psychological views of criminality have influenced crime control and prevention policy resulting in
<u>primary prevention programs</u> that seek to treat personal problems before they manifest themselves as crime. Along with this there have also been 

<u>secondary prevention programs</u> that provide treatment such as psychological counseling to youths and adults who are at risk for law violation, and 

<u>tertiary prevention programs</u> may be a requirement of a probation order, part of a diversionary sentence, or aftercare at the end of a prison sentence.
