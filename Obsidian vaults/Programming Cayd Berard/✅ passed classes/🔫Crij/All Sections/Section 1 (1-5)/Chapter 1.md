<u>Criminology</u> is the scientific approach to studying criminal behavior. Multidiciplinary

It includes within its scope the processes of making laws, of breaking laws, and of reacting toward the breaking of laws.

 Edwin Sutherland and Donald Cressey's definition of criminology includes some of the most important areas of interest to criminologists:
 - <u>Crime is a social phenomenon</u>: Criminals are influenced by their environment.
 - <u>The processes of making laws</u>: The reasoning behind laws and their creation is of great interest to criminologists,
 - <u>Breaking laws and reacting toward the breaking of laws</u>: Understanding why people commit crimes and what can be done to prevent such action is important, it is impossible to effectively control crime unless we understand its cause.
 - <u>Development of a body of general and verified principles</u>: Criminologists must use the scientific method when conducting research

Criminology and Criminal Justice are very different from each other:

- <u>Criminology</u> explains the origin, extent and nature of crime in society

- <u>Criminal Justice</u> refers to the study of the agencies of social control (police, courts, etc.) that treat criminal offenders.

both fields overlap as they are both crime related.

---

Criminology is also related to the study of deviant behaviors (actions that depart from social norms).

Crime and deviance are separate fields of study however:
- many crimes are not unusual or deviant.
- many deviant acts are either illegal nor criminal.

For example, someone who witnesses someone drowning is deviant, but not a criminal. People who let others burn, drown, or starve are not held in high esteem, but according to the law, they are not criminals.

---

Criminology in action refers to the efforts of criminologists to use their insight, training, and experience to understand human behavior and predict its occurrence.

---

The media loves to sensationalize crime as it pulls in big numbers making it important for criminologists to focus on the facts of the crimes.

To do this, criminologists will:
- Formulate techniques for collecting and analyzing institutional (police, court, etc.) records and data.
- Develop survey instruments to measure criminal activity not reported to the police by victims.
- Identify the victims of crime and create surveys designed to have victims report loss and injury that may not have been reported to the police.
- Develop data that can be used to test crime theory.

---

Socio-legal studies is a subarea of criminology concerned with the role that social forces play in shaping criminal law and, in turn, the role of criminal law in shaping society.

Very often the content of the law and the focus of criminological inquiry are highly integrated, making socio-legal research quite relevant.

Social science evidence is routinely used in death penalty cases. The pressure put on police, prosecutors, and jurors to secure a conviction in large cases such as murders, often lead to a higher chance of a wrongful conviction.

---

<u>Crime typology</u> - research on the links between different types of crime and criminals.

Research on criminal behavior systems and crime types is important because it enables criminologists to understand why people commit specific sorts of crime, and using this information, gives them the tools to devise crime reduction strategies.

---

Criminologists also are involved in creating effective crime policies, developing methods of social control, and the correction and control of known criminal offenders.

---

In two classic criminological studies it was understood that the study of crime is not complete unless the victim's role is considered. (victimology)

The study of penology, correction, and sentencing involves the treatment of known criminal offenders.

### Views of crime:

Professional criminologists usually align themselves with one of several schools of thought or perspectives in their field.

<u>Conflict View</u>
- The law is a tool of the ruling class.
- Crime is a politically defined concept.
- "Real crimes" are not outlawed.
- The law is used to control the underclass

<u>Consensus View</u>
- The law defines crime.
- The law reflects public opinion.
- Agreement exists on outlawed behavior.
- Laws apply to all citizens equally.

<u>Interactionist View</u>
- Moral entrepreneurs define crime.
- Crimes are illegal because society defines them that way.
- The definition of crime evolves according to the moral standards of those in power.

---

It is possible to take elements from each school of thought to formulate an integrated definition of crime, such as this one:

"Crime is a violation of societal rules of behavior as interpreted and expressed by a criminal legal code created by people holding social and political power. Individuals who violate these rules are subject to sanctions by state authority, social stigma, and loss of status."

---

Criminal behavior is always tied to the law making it important for criminologists to have an understanding of the development of law.

Crimes such as murder, burglary, arson, and rape fall under <u>common-law</u>.

---

The law can generally be divided into four broad categories:
- Substantive criminal law - branch of the law that defines crimes and their punishment.
- Procedural criminal law - laws that set out the basic rules of practice in the criminal justice system
- Civil law - The set of rules governing relations between private parties, including both individuals and organizations (such as business enterprises or corporations).
- Public or administrative law - The branch of law that deals with the government and its relationships with individuals or other governments

Regardless of its source, all criminal law in the United States must conform to the rules and dictates of the U.S. Constitution

---

The substantive criminal law defines crime and punishment.

Each state and the federal government have their own substantive criminal code, developed over many generations and incorporating moral beliefs, social values, and political, economic, and other societal concerns.


Criminal laws are divided into <u>felonies</u> and <u>misdemeanors</u>:
- a felony is a serious offense.
- a misdemeanor is a minor or petty crime.

### Common-law, Actus Reus and Mens Rea

 In order for a crime to occur, the state must show that the accused committed the guilty act, or *actus reus*, and had the *mens rea*, or criminal intent, to commit the act.

*actus reus* - may be an aggressive act or failure to act when there is a legal duty to do so.
*mens rea* - the person’s intent to commit the crime.

To satisfy the requirements of actus reus, guilty actions must be voluntary.  Even though an act may cause harm or damage, it is not considered a crime if it was done by accident or was an involuntary act.

Criminal intent exists if the results of an action, although originally unintended, are certain to occur.
##### <u>Strict Liability</u>
Though common-law crimes require that both the actus reus and the mens rea must be present before a person can be convicted of a crime, several crimes defined by statute do not require mens rea. In these cases, intent doesn't matter. For example, a person stopped for speeding is guilty of breaking the traffic laws regardless of whether he or she intended to go over the speed limit or did it by accident. <u>The underlying purpose of these laws is to protect the public; therefore, intent is not required.</u>

---

When people defend themselves against criminal charges, they must refute one or more of the elements of the crime of which they have been accused:

1.  defendants may deny the actus reus by arguing that they were falsely accused and that the real culprit has yet to be identified.
2. defendants may claim that although they engaged in the criminal act of which they are accused, they lacked the mens rea (intent) needed to be found guilty of the crime.

### What to Study
Criminologists are guided by their own scholarly interests, pressing social needs, the availability of accurate data, and other similar concerns.

### Who to Study
Too often, criminologists focus their attention on the poor and minorities while ignoring the middle-class criminal who may be committing white-collar crime, organized crime, or government crime.

### How to Study
When criminological research efforts involve experimentation and treatment, care must be taken to protect those subjects who have been chosen for experimental and control groups. Must avoid any bias as it would be unfair/unethical.
