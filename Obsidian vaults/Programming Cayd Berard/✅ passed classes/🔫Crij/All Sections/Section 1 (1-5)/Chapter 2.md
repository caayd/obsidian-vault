# Primary Sources of Data

"Official" crime data is that collected from local law enforcement agencies by the FBI and published yearly in their <u>Uniform Crime Report</u> (UCR).

UCR is the best known and most widely cited source of official crime statistics, including both crimes reported to local law enforcement departments and the number of arrests made by police agencies.

- its major unit of analysis involves <u>index crimes</u> or <u>Part I crimes</u>, consisting of murder and nonnegligent manslaughter, forcible rape, robbery, aggravated assault, burglary, larceny, arson, and motor theft. (These crimes are defined in 2-1a.
- There is also <u>Part II crimes</u> which consists of criminal acts such as sex crimes, drug trafficking, and vandalism.

### Compiling UCR

The methods used to compile the UCR are quite complex. Each month law enforcement agencies report the number of index crimes known to them. Complaints found false are eliminated from the actual count. 

The UCR uses three methods to express crime data:
1. The number of crimes reported to the police is expressed as raw numbers.
2. Crime rates per 100,000 people are computed using the equation: $$\dfrac{Number~of~Reported~Crimes}{Total~U.S. Population} \times100,000=Rate~per~100,000$$
3. The FBI computes changes in rate of crime and the number of crimes over time.

Crime agencies also report how many crimes are <u>cleared</u>, which happens when:
1. at least one person is arrested, charged, and turned over to the court for prosecution; or
2. by exceptional means, when some element beyond police control precludes the physical arrest of an offender (e.g., the offender leaves the country).

### Validity of UCR

Inconsistent reporting practices, law enforcement reporting practices, and methodological issues are the main reasons people question the UCR's validity/accuracy.

- Inconsistent reporting - Less than half of all violent crimes and only one-third of property crimes are reported to the police.
-  Law enforcement reporting practices - Some police departments define crimes loosely and make errors in UCR reporting, changes in reporting can shape the crime trends reported in the UCR.
- Methodological Issues - issues such as the ones below lead to questions about UCR's validity:
	- No federal crimes are reported.
	- Reports are voluntary and vary in accuracy and completeness.
	- Not all police departments submit reports.
	- The FBI uses estimates in its total crime projections.
	- In a multiple-offense incident, only the most serious crime is counted ("Hierarchy Rule")
	- Each act is listed as a single offense for some crimes but not for others.
	- Incomplete acts are lumped together with completed ones.

#### National Incident-Based Reporting System (NIBRS)

The NIBRS is the result of a five-year redesign effort was undertaken to provide more comprehensive and detailed crime statistics.

Under NIBRS, law enforcement authorities provide information to the FBI on each criminal incident involving one or more of 46 specific offenses, including the 8 Part I crimes, that occur in their jurisdiction; arrest information on the 46 offenses plus 11 lesser offenses is also provided in NIBRS.

Today, 6,520 law enforcement agencies, representing coverage of more than 93 million U.S. inhabitants, submit NIBRS data, which is 35 percent of all law enforcement agencies that participate in the UCR program.

#### Survey Research

The second primary source of crime/victimization measurement is through surveys in which people are asked about their attitudes, beliefs, values, and characteristics, as well as their experiences with crime and victimization.

---
#### The National Crime Victimization Survey (NCVS)

Because more than half of all victims do not report their experiences to the police, the UCR cannot measure all the annual criminal activity. This is why the federal gov't sponsors the NCVS (began in 1973).

It provides information about: 
1. **victims** (age, sex, race, ethnicity, marital status, income, and educational level).
2. **offenders** (sex, race, approximate age, and victim–offender relationship).
3. **Crimes** (time and place of occurrence, use of weapons, nature of injury, and economic consequences).

It is administered to persons age 12+ from a nationally representative sample of households. Once selected, households remain in the sample for three years, and eligible persons in these households are interviewed every six months either in person or over the phone for a total of seven interviews.

The data is weighted to reflect population totals and to compensate for survey nonresponse and other aspects of the sample design.

#### Self-Report Surveys

Self-reports are generally given anonymously in groups, participants in self-report surveys are asked to describe, in detail, their recent and lifetime participation in criminal activity.

They are used to measure trends and patterns in teen substance abuse, something that official data would never be able to assess.

### Evaluating the Primary Sources of Crime Data
 - <u>UCR</u> contains information on the number and characteristics of people arrested, information that the other data sources lack and it also provides unique data on homicide rates and trends. However many reports end up not being sent through.
 - The <u>NCVS</u> includes unreported crime and important information on the personal characteristics of victims. This is important, but the limited samples and personal recollections that it relies on leads to many inaccuracies and doesn't include data on important crime patterns, including murder and drug abuse.
 - <u>Self-report</u> surveys provide unique information on the personal characteristics of offenders—such as their attitudes, values, beliefs, personal history, and psychological profiles—that is unavailable from any other source, but relies on the honesty of a population not generally known for accuracy and integrity (criminals).

# Secondary sources of data

- <u>Cohort</u> research - involves observing a group of people who share a like characteristic over time. It consists of many different ways of acquiring data from subjects and when carefully drawn can be possible to determine which life experiences produce criminal careers.

- <u>Experimental</u> research - Involves performing tests and controlled experiments to collect data on the cause of a crime. Research is done by manipulating or intervening in the lives of their subjects to see the outcome or the effect of the intervention. It usually consists of 3 elements:
	1. random selection of subjects
	2. a control or comparison group, and
	3. an experimental condition.

- <u>Observational and Interview</u> research - Research is done in interviews with firsthand people involved in a crime to further understand the situation. Along with this observational research can be done by criminologists following and observing criminals in real-time to gain insight into their motives and activities

- <u>Meta-Analysis and Systematic</u> review - Meta-analysis involves gathering data from a number of previous studies. Compatible information and data are extracted and pooled together, indicating relationships. Systematic review involves collecting the findings from previously conducted scientific studies that address a particular problem, appraising and synthesizing the evidence, and using the collective evidence to address a particular scientific question.

- <u>Data-Mining</u> -  uses multiple advanced computational methods, including artificial intelligence (the use of computers to perform logical functions), to analyze large data sets usually involving one or more data sources with a goal to identify significant and recognizable patterns, trends, and relationships that are not easily detected through traditional analytical techniques alone.

- <u>Crime Mapping</u> - Criminologists use crime maps to create graphic representations of the spatial geography of crime, allowing them to analyze and correlate a wide array of data to create immediate, detailed visuals of crime patterns.

# Crime Trends

By 1992, police recorded about 14.6 million crimes. Since then, the number of crimes has been in decline; in 2014, about 10 million crimes were reported to the police, a drop of more than 4 million recorded crimes from the peak despite an increasing national population.

Along with this, the number of victimizations reported to the NCVS has also shown a significant downturn, reaching a peak in 1993 and reaching a downfall of 80% by 2014.

Self-report results appear to be more stable than the UCR and NCVS data indicate.

There has been a marked decline in overall U.S. crime rates, which are now below those of other industrial nations, including England and Wales, Denmark, and Finland. This is difficult to fully prove however because the legal definitions of crime vary from country to country.

# Crime Patterns

Patterns in the crime rate seem to be linked to temporal and ecological factors. Some of the most important of these are discussed here:
- Location - Most reported crimes occur in confined geographical areas: there are stable block-by-block and neighborhood-by-neighborhood differences in the crime rate.
- Season - Crime rates are highest during the warm summer months of July and August. During the summer, teenagers, who usually have the highest crime levels, are out of school and have greater opportunity to commit crime.
- Time of Day - . Some crimes are more likely to take place at night while others are more common during daytime; others are time resistant and take place at any hour of the day (ie. robberies at night).
- Climate - Traditionally, the association between temperature and crime was thought to resemble an inverted U-shaped curve: crime rates increase with rising temperatures and then begin to decline at some point (85 degrees) when it may be too hot for any physical exertion.

#### Guns
According to the UCR, about two-thirds of all murders and 40 percent of robberies involve firearms; most of these weapons are handguns.

In a classic study, Gary Kleck and Marc Gertz claimed that as many as 400,000 people per year use guns in situations in which they later claim that the guns “almost certainly” saved lives.

Most firearms used for crime come from out of state, 60 percent of the new guns were likewise imported.

#### Social Class
It makes sense that crime is inherently a lower-class phenomenon. It seems logical that people who are outside the economic mainstream and therefore are unable to obtain desired goods and services legally will resort to illegal activities
- <u>Instrumental crimes</u> are those committed by indigent people to compensate for the lack of legitimate economic opportunity.
- <u>Expressive crimes</u>, such as rape and assault, are often done by people in poverty as a result of their frustration with what they believe to be an unfair and unjust society.

#### Age and Crime
Regardless of economic status, marital status, race, sex, and so on, younger people commit crime more often than their older peers.

Crime is attractive to young people because it brings social benefits. Kids who assume an outlaw persona find that their antisocial acts bring them increased social status among peers who admire their risk-taking behaviors.

Aging out of crime happens as kids who commit crime discontinue their illegal activities as they mature.

#### Gender and Crime
Male crime rates are much higher than those of females. Victims report that their assailant was male in more than 80 percent of all violent personal crimes.

This has to do often with how both genders are raised to view their role and position in life. Men tend to be more aggressive than women.

#### Race and Crime
African Americans make up about 12 percent of the general population, yet they account for almost 38 percent of Part I violent crime arrests and 28 percent of property crime arrests. According to self-report studies, by age 23 almost 50 percent of black males have been arrested (versus about 38 percent for white males).

This is due to:
- System Bias - An effect of unequal or biased treatment by the justice system. Police are more likely to stop, search, and arrest racial minorities than they are members of the white majority.
- Racial Profiling - Evidence of racial bias in the arrest process can be found in the use of racial profiling to stop African Americans and search their cars without probable cause or reasonable suspicion.
	- This profiling is though to originate when residents overestimate the proportion of minorities living in their neighborhood, which can lead to false perceptions and increased racist attitudes. This builds a racial threat that leads to a stepped-up effort to control and punish minority citizens.

#### Economic and Social Disparity
Racial and ethnic minorities are often forced to live in high-crime areas where the risk of victimization is significant. People who witness violent crime and are victimized may themselves engage in violence.

#### Immigration and Crime
There is a prevailing view that illegal immigrants are dangerous and violent people and that areas that house illegal immigrants experience a spike in their crime rates. How true is this perception? In reality, immigrants are far less likely than the average U.S. native to commit crime.

## Chronic Offenders/Criminal Careers
Crime data show that most offenders commit a single criminal act and upon arrest discontinue their antisocial activity, while others commit a few less serious crimes.

People that continue committing criminal acts upon arrest are called <u>career criminals</u> or <u>chronic offenders.</u>

The chronic crime behavior is thought to originate from kids who have been exposed to a variety of personal and social problems at an early age are the most at risk to repeat offending, a concept referred to as <u>early onset</u>.
