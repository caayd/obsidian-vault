## Socialization and Crime
**Sociological social psychology** - the study of human interactions and relationships that emphasizes such issues as group dynamics and socialization.
**Socialization** - the interactions people have with various organizations, institutions, and processes of society.

**Social process or socialization theory**
Most people are influenced by their family relationships, peer group associations, educational experiences, and interactions with authority figures, including teachers, employers, and agents of the justice system.
- If these relationships are *positive and supportive*, people are able to function effectively within society.
- if these relationships are *dysfunctional and destructive*, conventional success may be impossible, and criminal solutions may become a feasible alternative.

#### Family Relations
Evidence shows that youths who grow up in households characterized by conflict and tension, and where there is a lack of familial love and support, are more susceptible to the crime-promoting forces in the environment.

- **Family Stress** - Disrupted parenting caused by stress increases children’s risk of suffering developmental problems, such as depressed mood, substance abuse, and engaging in delinquent behaviors.
- **Divorce** - The strain created by family breakup can take a lifelong toll on children’s emotional lives and make them vulnerable to the crime-producing forces in the environment.
- **Family Deviance** -  When parents drink, take drugs, and commit crimes, the effects can be both devastating and long term. If they get arrested and wind up in prison, the effects of parental misbehavior are enhanced.
- **Parental Efficacy** - Effective parenting can help neutralize the effect of both individual (e.g., emotional problems) and social (e.g., delinquent peers) forces that promote delinquent behaviors.

#### Educational Experience
Children who do poorly in school, fail at their coursework, do not have a strong bond to the educational experience, lack educational motivation, and feel alienated are the most likely to engage in criminal acts. Dropping out has also been found to lead to increased crime rates in individuals.

#### Peer relations and Crime
People who get involved with delinquent peers are more likely to engage in delinquent behavior themselves and more likely to engage in the same types of acts as their friends.

#### Religion and Belief
*Richard Petts* found that religious participation helps reduce deviant behavior involvement throughout the life course, from adolescence until marriage.

# Branches of the Social Process
- **Social learning theory** - suggests that people learn the techniques and attitudes of crime from close and intimate relationships with criminal peers; crime is a learned behavior.
- **Social control theory** - maintains that everyone has the potential to become a criminal, but that most people are controlled by their bonds to society. Crime occurs when the forces that bind people to society are weakened or broken.
- **Social reaction theory (labeling theory)** -  says people become criminals when significant members of society label them as such, and they accept those labels as a personal identity.


## Social Learning Theory
Follows a belief that crime is a product of learning the norms, values, and behaviors associated with criminal behavior. The three most prominent forms of social learning theory are **differential association theory**, **differential reinforcement theory**, and **neutralization theory**.

- **Differential Association Theory** - created by *Edwin H. Sutherland*, states that that criminal acts are related to a person’s exposure to an excess amount of antisocial attitudes and values. Skills and motives conducive to crime are learned as a result of contacts with procrime values, attitudes, and definitions and other patterns of criminal behavior.
- **Differential Reinforcement Theory** - proposed by *Ronald Akers and Robert Burgess*, states that people learn to be neither “all deviant” nor “all conforming,” but rather strike a balance between the two opposing poles of behavior. This balance is usually stable, but it can undergo revision over time. **Differential reinforcement** occurs when behavior is either reward or punished while interacting with others.
- **Neutralization Theory** - created by *David Matza and Gresham Sykes* states that offenders adhere to conventional values while “drifting” into periods of illegal behavior. In order to drift, people must first overcome (neutralize) legal and moral values.

## Social Control Theory
Holds that all people have the potential to violate the law and that modern society presents many opportunities for illegal activity. Criminal activities, such as drug abuse and car theft, are often exciting pastimes that hold the promise of immediate reward and gratification.

- **Containment Theory** - created by *Walter Reckless* states that a strong self-image insulates a youth from the pressures and pulls of criminogenic influences in the environment.
- **Social Bond Theory** - created by *Travis Hirschi*, assumes that all individuals are potential law violators, but they are kept under control because they fear that illegal behavior will damage their relationships with friends, parents, neighbors, teachers, and employers. Without these social ties or bonds, and in the absence of sensitivity to and interest in others, a person is free to commit criminal acts.

## Social Reaction Theory
Explains how the creation of criminal careers rests on social interactions and encounters.
Roots from the **symbolic interaction theory** of sociologists *Charles Horton Cooley, George Herbert Mead, and Herbert Blumer*, which holds that people communicate via symbols—gestures, signs, words, or images—that stand for or represent something else (ex. wedding ring - marriage). 

An individual’s view of self is formed by interpreting how others in society view him or her.
- If we believe others see us as smart, attractive, and appealing, this appraisal will form the basis of our own self-image 
- If we believe, through thought or action, that people view us as unappealing, foolish, or dangerous, these negative traits will shape our selves.

#### Primary and Secondary Deviance
The labeling of Primary and Secondary Deviance originates from *Edwin Lemert*.
- **Primary Deviance** - deviant acts that do not help redefine the self-image and public image of the offender.
- **Secondary Deviance** -  accepting deviant labels as a personal identity. Acts become secondary when they form a basis for self-concept, as when a drug experimenter becomes an addict

## Public Policy Implications of Social Process Theory
Programs have been developed to increase people’s commitment to conventional lines of action.
**Diversion programs** - Programs of rehabilitation that remove offenders from the normal channels of the criminal justice system, thus avoiding the stigma of a criminal label.
**Restitution programs** -  Rather than face the stigma of a formal trial, an offender is asked to either pay back the victim of the crime for any loss incurred or do some useful work in the community in lieu of receiving a court-ordered sentence.
