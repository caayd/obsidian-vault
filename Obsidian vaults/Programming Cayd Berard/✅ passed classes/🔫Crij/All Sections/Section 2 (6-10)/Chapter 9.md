## Foundations of Developmental Theory
*Sheldon Glueck and Eleanor Glueck* are considered the founders of the developmental branch of criminological theory.
Integrating biological, social, and psychological elements, the *Gluecks*’ research suggested that the initiation and continuity of a criminal career was a **developmental process influenced by both internal and external situations, conditions, and circumstances.**

Developmental criminologists focus their attention on the factors that prompt one person to engage in persistent criminal activity leading to a criminal career.

- *Marvin Wolfgang* found that while many offenders commit a single criminal act and desist from crime, a small group of chronic offenders engage in frequent and repeated criminal activity and continue to do so across their life span.
- *Rolf Loeber and Marc LeBlanc*'s view stated that criminologists must pay attention to how a criminal career unfolds, how it begins, why it is sustained, and how it comes to an end.

### Concepts
- **Population heterogeneity** - The view that the propensity of an individual to participate in antisocial behavior is a relatively stable trait, unchanging over their life course. Some people are hotheaded, violent, and inclined to commit crime, while others remain reasoning, unruffled, and presumably law abiding.
- **State dependence** - The view that people change and develop as they mature; life events have a significant influence on future behavior. Supported by *Life course and trajectory theorists* as it explains continuity and desistance from crime: positive experiences can help 'fix' a troubled person, while negative ones can increase the chance of future criminal involvement. 


# Life Course, Latent Traits, and Trajectories
- **Life course theories** - sees criminality as a dynamic process, influenced by a multitude of individual characteristics, traits, and social experiences. As people travel through the life course, they are constantly experiencing changing perceptions and experiences, resulting in changes in behavior that may be for the better or worse.
- **Latent trait theories** - hold that human development is controlled by a stable propensity or “master trait,” present at birth or soon after. As people mature from childhood to adolescence to adulthood, this trait is always there, directing their behavior and shaping life events.
- **Trajectory theories** - suggests there are multiple trajectories in a criminal career, there are numerous subgroups within a population that follow distinctively different criminal career trajectories. Some people may begin involvement in antisocial activities in childhood and adolescence and demonstrate a precocious propensity for crime, while others begin later and are influenced by a different set of life circumstances. 

## Life Course
According to this view family, environmental, or personal problems may cause issues in an individual's development leading to issues. 

**People are influenced by different factors as they mature. Consequently, a factor that may have an important influence at one stage of life (such as delinquent peers) may have little influence later on.** Negative life events can have major impacts/influences on one's development.

### Concepts
- **Problem behavior syndrome (PBS)** - crime is one among a group of interrelated antisocial behaviors that cluster together including  family dysfunction, substance abuse, smoking, precocious sexuality and early pregnancy, educational underachievement, suicide attempts, sensation seeking, and unemployment, as well as crime. *Portrays crime as a type of social problem rather than the product of other social problems.*
- **Offense Specialization/Generalization** - Some criminals stick to a set of crime that they specialize in such as theft or rape, while others engage in a variety of crime depending on their likelihood of success.
- **Early Onset** - Children who will later become the most serious offenders begin their deviant careers at a very early (preschool) age, and the earlier the onset of criminality, the more frequent, varied, and sustained the criminal career. Aggressive children are more likely to be aggressive into adulthood. *Usually caused by unskilled parents*.
- **Persistence and Desistance** - Those who display conduct problems in youth are the ones most likely to commit crime as adults. *The best predictor of future criminality is past criminality.*

#### LC Theories
- **Age-graded theory** - Created by *Robert Sampson and John Laub*, states that traits and childhood experiences determine the onset of criminal behavior and highlights the importance of life experiences at pivotal ages and how they can make or break the trajectory of one's criminal career, *especially relationships*. Also states that formal criminals may abandon crime due to regular paths seeming 'more rewarding.' 
- **Social Schematic Theory (SST)** - Created by *Ronald Simons and Callie Burt* states that crime is a result of an individual learning to define situations as requiring or justifying aggression, coercion, or cheating (self justification for crime, delusion). Criminals develop **social schemas** that exclude pertinent information and instead focus only on things that confirm preexisting beliefs and ideas validifying their actions.

## Latent Trait
*David Rowe, D. Wayne Osgood, and W. Alan Nicewander* first proposed the concept of latent traits in 1990
- **Latent trait** - A stable feature, characteristic, property, or condition, present at birth or soon after, that makes some people crime prone over the life course. Traits include **defective intelligence, damaged or impulsive personality, genetic abnormalities, the physical-chemical functioning of the brain, and environmental influences on brain function such as drugs, chemicals, and injuries.**

#### LT Theories
- **General Theory of Crime (GTC)** - created by *Michael Gottfredson and Travis Hirschi*, states that the propensity to commit crime is linked to two latent traits: an impulsive personality and a lack of self-control.

## Trajectory Theory
Follows a basic premise is that there is more than one path to crime and more than one class of offender. Because all people are different, no single model of criminality can hope to describe every person’s journey through life.

### Concepts
- **Early, Late, and Nonstarters** - Not all persistent offenders begin at an early age. Some are precocious, beginning their criminal careers early and persisting into adulthood.
- **Chronic Offending** - Chronic offenders can be divided into subgroupings: some are very high-rate offenders, whereas other chronics offend relatively infrequently but are persistent in their criminal activities, never really stopping.
- **Pathways to Crime** - There is different roads criminals may partake in during their criminal journey, and also different paths they make take to get there.
- **Adolescent-Limited Offenders** - Offender who follows the most common criminal trajectory, in which antisocial behavior peaks in adolescence and then diminishes.
- **Life course persisters** - One of the small group of offenders whose criminal career continues well into adulthood.
