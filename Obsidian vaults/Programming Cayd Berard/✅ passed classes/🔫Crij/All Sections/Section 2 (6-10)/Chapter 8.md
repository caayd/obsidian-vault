## The Historical Development of Critical Criminology
Critical criminology traces back to social philosopher *Karl Marx* who identified the economic structures in society that control all human relations.

#### Productive Forces and Productive Relations
*Marx* believed that production had two components:
- **Productive forces** - Technology, energy sources, and material resources.
- **Productive relations** -  Relationships that exist among the people producing goods and services.

- **capitalist bourgeoisie** - The owners of the means of production.
- **proletariat** - Working class members of society who produce goods and services but who do not own the means of production.

*Marx* believed societies and their structures were not stable and, therefore, could change through slow evolution or sudden violence. If social conflicts are not resolved, they tend to destabilize society, leading to social change.

### Marxist Vision of Crime
Although he didn't state many views on crime, *Karl Marx*'s views on the relationship between the concept of crime and social conflict were first applied by three scholars: 
- *Willem Bonger* - Bonger believed that society is divided into have and have-not groups, not on the basis of people’s innate ability, but because of the system of production that is in force. Because the **proletariat** are deprived of the materials that are monopolized by the **bourgeoisie**, they are more likely to violate the law.
- *Ralf Dahrendorf* - Argued that modern society is organized into what he called imperatively coordinated associations consisting of two groups: those who possess authority and use it for social domination and those who lack authority and are dominated.
- *George Vold*. - Argued that laws are created by politically oriented groups, who seek the government’s assistance to help them defend their rights and protect their interests. If a group can marshal enough support, a law will be created to hamper and curb the interests of some opposition group.

## Creating a Critical Criminology
Critical criminologists devote their attention to a number of important themes and concepts ranging from:
- The use and misuse of power
- The ability of people and groups to determine and control the behavior of others and to shape public opinion to meet their personal interests.

They may focus on how people in wealthier, higher power roles in society may be given lenient punishments for very serious crimes, whilst offenders such as petty thieves and drug dealers are given stricter penalties and forced to live with a stain on their career.

## How Critical Criminologists Define Crime
According to critical theorists, crime is a political concept designed to protect the power and position of the upper classes at the expense of the poor. 
Criminals are not a group of outsiders who can be controlled by increased law enforcement. Criminality, instead, is a function of social and economic organization. **To control crime and reduce criminality, societies must remove the social conditions that promote crime.**

## How Critical Criminologists View the Cause of Crime
- **surplus value** - Marxist view that the laboring classes produce wealth that far exceeds their wages and goes to the capitalist class as profits.
- **marginalization** - Displacement of workers, pushing them outside the economic and social mainstream.

#### Failing Social Institutions
Critical thinkers often focus on contemporary social institutions to show how they operate as instruments of class and racial oppression. Critical scholars find that class bias and racial oppression exist from the cradle to the grave.

#### Important topics/terms
- **Globalization** - The process of creating transnational markets, politics, and legal systems in an effort to form and sustain a global economy.
- **State-organized crime** - Acts defined by law as criminal and committed by state officials, either elected or appointed, in pursuit of their jobs as government representatives.

## Instrumental v. Structural Theory
- **Instrumental theorists** - The view that criminal law and the criminal justice system are capitalist instruments for controlling the lower class.
- **Structural theorists** - The view that criminal law and the criminal justice system are means of defending and preserving the capitalist system.

###### Instrumental Theory
- The poor may or may not commit more crimes than the rich, but they certainly are arrested and punished more often.
- The poor are driven to crime because a natural frustration exists in a society in which affluence is well publicized but unattainable.
- Then class conflict becomes unbearable, frustration can spill out in riots and urban unrest.
- Theorists find it important to unmask the law and justice system's true purpose.

###### Structural Theory
- The relationship between law and capitalism is unidirectional, always working for the rich and against the poor.
- The law is designed to keep the system operating efficiently, and anyone, worker or owner, who rocks the boat is targeted for sanction.

## Research on Critical Criminology
Critical researchers have found disturbing evidence that at every stage of justice, criminal members of powerless, disenfranchised groups are treated less favorably than the wealthy and powerful.

Research has found that social institutions are designed to **favor the rich and powerful** and to **oppress those who lack economic power and social standing.**

## Alternative Views of Critical Theory
- **Left Realism** - associated w/ *John Lea and Jock Young* crime is a function of relative deprivation under capitalism and favors pragmatic, community-based crime prevention and control.
- **Critical Feminism** - (*Chesney-Lind*) views gender inequality as stemming from the unequal power of men and women in a capitalist society, which leads to the exploitation of women by fathers and husbands. Women are considered a commodity worth possessing, like land or money. Also focuses on discrimination against LGBTQ.
- **Power–Control Theory** - created by *John Hagan*, states that crime and delinquency rates are a function of two factors: class position (power) and family functions (control). Parents reproduce the power relationships they hold in the workplace; a position of dominance at work is equated with control in the household. As a result, parents’ work experiences and class position influence the criminality of children.
- **Peacemaking movement** - created by *Larry Tifft and Dennis Sullivan*, has inspirations ranging from Quakerism to Zen, considers punitive crime control strategies to be counterproductive and favors the use of humanistic conflict resolution to prevent and control crime. Main purpose of promoting a peaceful, just society.

## Critical Theory and Public Policy
All branches of social conflict theory revolve around the fact the **conflict causes crime**. 
**restorative justice** - adopted by peacemakers, methods using humanistic, nonpunitive strategies to right wrongs and restore social harmony. Defined by *Howard Zehr*.

##### Reintegrative Shaming\
**Reintegrative shaming** - originated from *John Braithwaite*, a method of correction that encourages offenders to confront their misdeeds, experience shame because of the harm they caused, and then be reincluded in society.
