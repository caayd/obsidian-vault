## Development of Sociological Criminology
The application of sociological concepts to criminology can be traced to the works of pioneering sociologists:
- *Adolphe Quetelet* - instigated the use of data and statistics in performing criminological research.
- *David Émile Durkheim* - defined crime as a normal and necessary social event.

According to Émile Durkheim’s vision of social positivism, crime is part of human nature because it has existed during periods of both poverty and prosperity. Crime is **normal** because it is virtually impossible to imagine a society in which criminal behavior is totally absent. Since people are so different from one another and employ such a variety of methods and forms of behavior to meet their needs, it is not surprising that some will resort to criminality.

#### The Chicago School and Beyond
AKA the University of Chicago, contains a popular sociology department organized by **Albion W. Small**. 
The Chicago School sociologists supported the view that **neighborhood conditions**, and not individual pathology, **were the key influence on behavior and in so doing shaped the direction of crime rates**. 

## Socioeconomic Structure and Crime
**Stratified society** - social structure that places people along a status-based hierarchy.
**Social classes** - segments of the population whose members have a relatively similar portion of desirable things and who share attitudes, values, norms, and an identifiable lifestyle.

People in lower social classes tend to suffer from serious disadvantages leading them to resort to any means possible to get by.

### The Underclass
**Underclass** - term coined by sociologist *Oscar Lewis*, the lowest level of social class, often generational. Members lack the education and skills needed to function successfully in modern society.

#### Child Poverty
- 22% of all youth in the US live in families with incomes below the poverty line, another 22% escape poverty but still live in families considered poor.
- Children who grow up in low-income homes are less likely to achieve in school and less likely to complete their schooling than children with more wealthy parents.
- Poor kids are also more likely to suffer from health problems and to receive inadequate health care.
- 1 in ever 30 children are homeless.

#### Minority Group Poverty
 - The median family income of Hispanics and African Americans is two-thirds that of whites, and the percentage of racial and ethnic minorities living in poverty is double that of European Americans.
 - While fewer than 10 percent of white neighborhoods can be considered poverty stricken, **75 percent of black, Latino, and other minority communities can be considered poverty areas.**
- In the United States today, about 1 in 30 men between the ages of 20 and 34 is behind bars, for black males in that age group the figure is 1 in 9.

## Social Structure Theories
Criminologists have formulated **social structure theories** to further study the problems caused by poverty an income inequality:
- **Social disorganization theory** - focuses on the conditions within the urban environment that affect crime rates. A disorganized area is one in which institutions of social control (ex. schools, law enforcement) have broken down and can no longer carry out their expected or stated functions.

- **Strain theory** - states that because members of the lower class are unable to achieve success through conventional means, they feel anger, frustration, and resentment, referred to as **strain**, which causes them to choose alternative ways such as crime.

- **Cultural deviance theory** - *combines elements of both strain and social disorganization*: In lower-class neighborhoods a unique subculture develops that maintains a unique set of values and beliefs that are in conflict with conventional social norms. This leads to criminal behavior becoming a natural expression of conformity to one's environment rather a form of deviancy.

## Social disorganization Theories
###### Community fear and change
People feel safe in neighborhoods that are orderly and in repair. In contrast, those living in neighborhoods that suffer social and physical incivilities are more likely to be fearful. Fear causing factors such as race, gangs, and feelings of mistrust/lack of power all contribute to feelings of fear in ones' environment which can lead to increased criminals activity due to people leaving.

As areas decline, some residents flee to safer, more stable localities. Those who cannot leave because they cannot afford to live in more affluent communities face an increased risk of victimization.

###### Collective Efficacy
**Collective efficacy** - Social control exerted by cohesive communities (communities with shared interpersonal relationships among members), based on mutual trust, including intervention in the supervision of children and maintenance of public order.

This behavior is often lacking in disorganized neighborhoods in which the lack of social cohesion produces an atmosphere where antisocial behavior becomes normative and crime rates increase.

## Strain Theories
###### Concept of Anomie
Created by *Émile Durkheim* an **anomic** society is one in which rules of behavior, such as social norms, have broken down or become inoperative during periods of rapid social change or social crisis such as war or famine.

Contemporary **strain theories come in two distinct formulations**:
- **Structural strain** - Using a sociological lens, structural strain suggests that economic and social sources of strain shape collective human behavior.
- **Individual strain** - Using a psychological reference, individual strain theories suggest that individual life experiences cause some people to suffer pain and misery, feelings that are then translated into antisocial behaviors.

##### All Theories Summed:
- **Merton's Theory** - Created by *Robert Merton*, states that when socially mandated goals are uniform throughout society and access to legitimate means is bound by class and status, the resulting strain produces anomie among those who are locked out of the legitimate opportunity structure.
- **Institutional Anomie Theory (IAT)** - Created by *Steven Messner and Richard Rosenfeld*, states that  the relatively high U.S. crime rates can be explained by the interrelationship between culture and institutions in which many people will develop wishes and desires for material goods that cannot be satisfied by legitimate means.
- **Relative Deprivation Theory** - Proposed by *Judith Blau and Peter Blau*, states that lower-class people may feel both deprived and embittered when they compare their life circumstances to those of the more affluent/wealthy causing motives of deviant/criminal behavior to spark.
- **General Strain Theory (GST)** - Created by *Robert Agnew*, states that multiple sources of strain interact with an individual’s emotional traits and responses to produce criminality. Sources include: Failure to achieve positively valued goals, failure to meet personal idea of success, removal of positively valued stimuli, and presentation of negative stimuli.

#### Sources of Strain
###### Social Sources
- People may begin to feel strain because of their membership in a peer or social group.
- People who report feelings of stress and anger are more likely to interact with others who are similarly stressed out.

###### Adolescent Sources
- Some kids are going through trauma of family breakup and frequent changes in family structure find themselves feeling a high degree of strain.
- As they mature, children’s expectations increase; some find that they are unable to meet academic and social demands.

###### Community Sources
- Communities influence the goals people pursue and the ability people have to meet these goals.
- Communities influence feelings of relative deprivation and exposure to aversive stimuli, including family conflict, incivility, and economic deprivation.
- Communities influence the likelihood that angry, strain-filled individuals will interact with one another.

## Cultural Deviance Theories
##### All Theories Summed:
- **Conduct Norms** - Created by *Thorsten Sellin*, states that criminal law is an expression of the rules of the dominant culture and that the content of the law may create a clash between conventional, middle-class rules and splinter groups, such as ethnic and racial minorities who are excluded from the social mainstream causing them to maintain their own set of **conduct norms.**
- **Focal Concerns** - Created by *Walter Miller*, states that the clinging of lower class individuals to focal concerns promotes illegal or violent behavior. Focal concerns include the needs for excitement, trouble, smartness, and personal autonomy.
- **Theory of Delinquent Subcultures** - Developed by *Albert Cohen*, states that, because social conditions make them incapable of achieving success legitimately, lower-class youths experience a form of culture conflict that Cohen labels status frustration, leading many to join together in gangs and participate in delinquent behavior.
- **Theory of Differential Opportunity** - Created by *Richard Cloward and Lloyd Ohlin*, combines strain and social disorganization principles. Revolves around the concept of **differential opportunity**, which states that people in all classes of society share the same success goals but that those in the lower class have limited means of achieving them.
