Composer: Ludwig van Beethoven

From classical period of music (1750-1820) many of his songs are so famous that they are still well known in the current year.

I chose Beethoven because I feel as though he composed some of the most well known and influential pieces of music, I also find it extremely interesting that he had gone deaf at 44 and continued to make great music.
