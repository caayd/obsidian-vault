## TOPIC - AI TAKING OVER COMPUTER SCIENCE JOBS

I will have to be either for or against this topic

Chat GPT is a language model making it far more accessible to others, as it is designed to give a user what they what, rather than perform only a handful of tasks

 machine-learning program that reads and writes like a human

machine learning- AI is developed through this process, where people feed the computer information and the computer uses it to further develop its artificial neural network

##### More specifically - AI and its effects on the computer science industry.

## My opinion
---
Although AI poses a great threat to many jobs, with a heavy target on comp-sci jobs, I believe that AI will end up becoming more of a tool for programmers to use, as a way to find workarounds to issues they may come up with. Like a helping hand, like when you hold the flashlight for your dad at night so he can see what he's working on. 

While there is a chance that it ends up taking over the comp-sci world entirely, I think that this wont happen as it is the same field that AI originated from in the first place. At the very worst, AI takes over current comp-sci jobs, and puts more people into newer comp-sci jobs that revolve around managing AI. 

It's a strange thought, but changes are bound to happen from this groundbreaking technology, and I think that the last thing we should do is shut it down, as it is a massive step in increasing efficiency.

Things to talk about:

- Issue is so bad and advanced, many courses and colleges have already developed rules against the use of AI services such as ChatGPT. Some Courses have also started allowing the use of it for "creative purposes," poses a serious question of how our future will look like.

- Mention already there services, copilot, chatgpt (becoming more advanced), 

- Many new language models posses a dangerous lack of regulation may lead to many issues.

- Many other jobs at risk, not just comp-sci, however the idea of computers making computers is something straight out of a sci-fi horror film






## Structure (planned)
---

1. Introduction - Introduce the idea of ai and explain how it has been affecting the world. At some point mention chat gpt and how it is a language model, which means it interperents and outputs text based off of what is received. Also mention how there are ccurrent negative effects seen in schools (mention source).
2. My first opinion/Thesis intro - Introduce how it may effect the computer science world. "With all of the fear centered around AI taking over, its important to consider the benefits of what may come."
3. BP #1 - <u>Improved understandability</u>. AI can be a great teaching tool to new programmers and can help find issues in ones program or explain core principles. 
4. BP #2 - <u>Improved efficiency.</u> AI can be a great tool that can be used to increase the speed at which large pieces of code are written. (how it can be utilized as a tool source)
5. BP #3 - <u>Not always accurate </u>. This will serve more as a naysayer but will show that once we obtain more control, AI will become a crucial step in changing our world. proves that although it may be inaccurate at times, it still provides a net positive.
6. BP #4 - <u>Effect on jobs</u>. Strange take but important to acknowledge, even if the current comp sci jobs get taken over, more jobs will open up in managing AI and improving it. While evolution of AI is scary fast, its important to understand that there are people behind the advancements.
7. Conclusion -

### Teachers speaking on the issue of AI in class

An interview was done on many teachers regarding AI use in school, it covers students cheating and presents a important point that the use of AI will end up further degrading our brains.

“In my opinion, offering AI to students gives them the opportunity to learn less. The AI does the work for them. Students only have to type in what their teacher is requiring to ChatGPT and the AI does the work for them. We worry about the reading stamina of students—this AI junk will ruin their learning stamina and work ethic” (para. 17). -Middle school science teacher from Colorado

### Facts and good questions about what AI poses to us as a whole, and how it may benefit us in the future.

In the article it is mentioned that OpenAI, founders of the team behind ChatGPT, published a paper predicting that "...at least 10 percent of work done by approximately 80 percent of Americans will be affected by AI" (Di 48).

"How can our educational system reassess the advantages of humans in the age of AI? How do we enhance our lifelong learning ability and effectively" (Di 49).

"But from past experience, every technological era ultimately creates more job opportunities than it eliminates" (Di 49).

### Great rundown of current AI giants

It gets mentioned how 10 years ago jobs of journalists, scientists, software engineers, art directors, and architects were all at low risk of being automated, then states:
"Fast-forward a decade and Large Language Models (LLMs) like GPT-4 can now answer questions and write essays in astonishingly human-like fashion. Image generators like DALL-E 2 can transform text prompts into new images, mirroring the creative work of designers and advertising executives, not to mention GitHub’s Copilot, an AI-powered “pair programmer” capable of writing code" (Benedikt and Osborne 2).

"OpenAI, an American artificial intelligence research laboratory, reports that their LLM passed a simulated bar exam, SAT Math section, and introductory sommelier training with a score around the top 10% of test takers.4 In just a few months, as the world moved from GPT-3.5 to GPT4, AI leaped from the 39th to the 96th percentile of human-level performance in solving college physics problems" (Benedikt and Osborne 2).

### How it can be utilized as a tool

mentioning the current state of AI and software development tools:

"In fact, this can even lead to the development of AI-based predictive analysis that allows human developers to more easily interact with code using natural language commands and queries as part of the software development process" (Wong et al. 2).

- This can increase the accessibility of computer programming to many people who may have found it hard to stand. AI can provide great explanations for why and how something works. 

 In a study that tested different LLMs with specializations in writing programs and aiding a programmer it was found that it can "...ultimately improve the quality and productivity of AI-assisted programming, making it easier for programmers to create high-quality software with fewer errors in less time" (Wong et al. 15).

### Coding AI and how it benefits users

"One of the more heralded aspects of AI-assisted coding is that users don't have to be versed in software development. Natural language processing allows even business users to simply write a prompt and get back the software needed for any number of projects" (Lucas para. 22).

"Among GitClear's findings was that developers write code 55% faster when using Copilot. When GitClear looked at GitHub's code quality and maintainability compared to what would have been written by a human, it found less experienced developers have a greater advantage with AI-assisted programming compared to veteran developers" (Lucas para. 34).

"What's not in question is that over time, software generation tools will continue to improve -- though there will always be the need for a human in the loop" (Lucas para. 56).
